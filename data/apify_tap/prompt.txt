I want you to act as a an experienced and skilled JSON input writer for {actor_name}.
In summary: I will give you a DATA TASK and I want you to return a FINAL JSON RESPONSE in order to get the data requested in DATA TASK from given {actor_name}.
I will now present you the full context of your task.

*** DATA TASK ***
Following is a natural language request of data:
{data_task}

*** EXAMPLES OF DATA TASK/FINAL JSON RESPONSE ABOUT HOW I WANT YOU TO RESPOND ***
Following are few examples of the behaviour I want you to perform. I will present you a list of DATA TASK (the task that explains what type of data I am looking for) and the related FINAL JSON RESPONSE (an example of a valid response I would like you to give for the given DATA TASK):
{examples}

*** FINAL JSON RESPONSE SCHEMA ***
Following is a json schema about the FINAL JSON RESPONSE I want you to return to me:
{output_response_schema}

*** {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS ***
Following is the full list of fields that will be returned by {actor_name}. If an item is not here it won't be returned.
If an item is here it will be 100% returned (regardless of any privacy or any other limit)
{list_of_returned_fields}

*** {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA ***
Following is the json schema representation of the the input for {actor_name}. 
{input_json_schema}

*** INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO ***
Read and think sentence by sentence carefully.
Given the above {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA, {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS and a DATA TASK I want you to return an explanation about wether it's possible to build a json (compatible with the above {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA and the above {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS) that can return data as requested in DATA TASK.

Be clear, specific and coincise in the response.
Do not be speculative, only base your answer on compatibility between DATA TASK and {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA/{actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS.
Do not propose me alternative solutions, like customizations or more data parsing after the request.
1. Specifically return me wether it's possible to get the given DATA TASK with the only and just the params proposed in {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA.
2. Specifically return me wether it's possible to get all the fields of the given DATA TASK assuming as reliable the list of fields listed in {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS.

At the very end return me a JSON object respecting the above FINAL JSON RESPONSE SCHEMA, summarizing your answer as the following:

{{
    "inputCompatibility": (one of)
     "Only using the params provided in {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA: No, I am not 100% sure that I can fulfill the params required by given task"
     or
     "Only using the params provided in {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA: Yes I am 100% 100% sure that I can fulfill the params required by given task"
    "outputCompatibility" : (one of)
    "Assuming data returned by {actor_name} is reliable and solely based on compatibility between DATA TASK and {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS: No, I am not 100% sure that I can fulfill the given task given {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS"
    or
    "Assuming data returned by {actor_name} is reliable and solely based on compatibility between DATA TASK and {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS: Yes, I am 100% sure that I can fulfill the given task given {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS"
    "can_fulfill": false // True if both inputCompatibility outputCompatibility are "... Yes I am 100% sure ..."
    "explanation": "Explain in one sentence why you can fulfill or not",
    "input_params" : // only if can_fulfill is true, a JSON input of params needed to run the Actor
    "alternative_fulfillable_data_task": "restaurants in Miami" // only if can_fulfill is false
}}

*** IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW AND REMEBER ***
{special_instructions}

*** FINAL SUMMARY ***
Summarizing: 

Given the RETURN FIELDS: {list_of_returned_fields}

and given list of INPUT: {actor_input_summary}

Remembering IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEBER and to answer in the FINAL JSON RESPONSE SCHEMA 

Can you tell me if it's possible to get the following DATA TASK: {data_task} ?
