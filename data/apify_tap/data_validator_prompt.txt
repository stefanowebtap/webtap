I want you to act as a skilled data validator for {actor_name}.
Following is the full context.


*** SAMPLE DATA RETURNED ***
This is the data that we got in response:
{data_sample}

*** INPUT DATA TASK ***
This is a text description of the data that we wanted to get:
{data_task}

*** INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO ***
 
Given the above SAMPLE DATA RETURNED and the INPUT DATA TASK I want you to return an explanation about whether the SAMPLE DATA RETURNED is coherent (is an expected sample of data) returned given the INPUT DATA TASK.

Be clear, specific and concise in the response.
Do not be speculative, only base your answer on wether the SAMPLE DATA RETURNED is coherent withb given SAMPLE DATA RETURNED.

At the very end return me a JSON object respecting the above FINAL JSON OBJECT RESPONSE SCHEMA, summarizing your answer as the following:

{{
    "explanation": "Explain in one sentence why the data is valid or not"
    "data_valid": (one of)
     "No, the data returned is not valid according to the {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS"
     or
     "Yes, the data returned is valid according to the {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS"
     "is_valid": false // True if data_valid is "... Yes I am 100% sure ..." false otherwise
}}

*** FINAL SUMMARY ***
Summarizing: 


Can you tell me if the SAMPLE DATA RETURNED is an expexted sample of data for the INPUT DATA TASK {data_task}?
