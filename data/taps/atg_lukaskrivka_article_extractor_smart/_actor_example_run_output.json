At least 20 people have reportedly been killed and five others injured on Thursday after a school that is being used as a shelter was damaged at the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, the agency said in its latest update. The Jabalia camp, the largest in the Gaza Strip, has come under intense bombardment since Tuesday.The agency said that another school at al-Shati refugee camp, also in northern Gaza, was damaged, with one child reportedly killed.\n\nFurther south, two schools-turned-shelters in the Al Bureij Refugee Camp were hit. Two people were reportedly killed and 31 injured.\n\nThese shelters, which hosted nearly 20,000 displaced Palestinians, \u201cshould be a safe haven, under the flag of the United Nations\u201d, the agency said.Since 7 October, 72 UNRWA staff have been killed, often with their families, it said.\n\nOvernight, we lost Mai, a bright software developer in her mid-20s with physical disabilities. She was displaced from her home and killed in the Jabalia refugee camp with members of her family.\n\nHow many more? How much more grief and suffering? A humanitarian ceasefire is overdue for the sake of humanity.\n\nThe Israeli mission to the United Nations said it was preparing a response to the joint statement by the UN experts. Speaking to Reuters after the statement was issued, one of the signatories said the people of Gaza had been deprived of the \u201cthe most basic elements for living\u201d.Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, said:\n\nWe are using the term \u2018risk of genocide\u2019 because the process that is (underway) is absolutely indiscriminate; affecting, in this case, more than 2 million people.\n\nAnd in this sense, I think we are facing a risk of genocide, effectively.\n\nThe UN experts called for a ceasefire in Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to reach those who need it the most. A ceasefire would also allow channels to be opened to ensure the release of hostages held in Gaza, they said in a statement.They called on all parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, adding:\n\nThe Palestinian people in Gaza, particularly women, children, persons with disabilities, youth, and older persons, have endured decades of hardship and deprivation. We call on Israel and its allies to agree to an immediate ceasefire. We are running out of time.\n\nThey expressed concern about the safety of UN and humanitarian workers and hospitals and schools in Gaza, as well as the safety of journalists, media workers and their family members.\n\nThe UN experts said they felt \u201cdeepening horror\u201d about Israeli airstrikes against the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, which the local health ministry said have killed and injured hundreds of Palestinians since Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli airstrike on a residential complex in the Jabalia refugee camp is a brazen violation of international law \u2013 and a war crime. Attacking a camp sheltering civilians, including women and children, is a complete breach of the rules of proportionality and distinction between combatants and civilians.\n\nUnicef has separately described \u201chorrific and appalling\u201d scenes of carnage after two rounds of Israeli airstrikes on the Jabalia refugee camp on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nPeople\u2019s homes have been levelled, hundreds apparently injured and killed, with many children reportedly among the casualties.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry called the strikes a \u201cheinous massacre\u201d that killed 195 people, including seven hostages. Israeli officials said the bombing had killed senior Hamas commanders who sought to shield behind civilians.\n\nTime is running out to prevent genocide in Gaza, UN experts warnA group of United Nations experts have called for a ceasefire in Gaza, warning that \u201ctime is running out\u201d as Palestinian people there find themselves at \u201cgrave risk of genocide\u201d.A statement from a group of UN-mandated experts, including the special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, expressed \u201cdeep frustration with Israel\u2019s refusal to halt plans to decimate\u201d the Gaza Strip. It says:\n\nWe remain convinced that the Palestinian people are at grave risk of genocide. The time for action is now. Israel\u2019s allies also bear responsibility and must act now to prevent its disastrous course of action.\n\nAll signs are that Gaza has \u201creached a breaking point\u201d, the experts went on to say, pointing to images from the weekend of people desperately grabbing essentials from a UN warehouse, or reports of children being forced to drink sea water in the absence of clean water. The situation in Gaza has reached a \u201ccatastrophic tipping point\u201d, they said, warning of the dire need for food, water, medicine, fuel and essential supplies and the risk of looming health hazards.\n\nWater is essential to human life and today, 2 million Gazans are struggling to find drinking water.\n\nDozens of students walked out of a class taught by Hillary Clinton in New York on Wednesday in protest at their university\u2019s alleged role in the \u201cshaming\u201d of pro-Palestinian demonstrators. About 30 students were involved in the protest at Columbia University, where the former secretary of state and previous senator for the state was delivering a foreign policy lecture as part of her global affairs class.The walkout followed an incident last week in which photographs of students who signed a declaration blaming Israel for the 7 October Hamas attacks were displayed on video screens on trucks parked near the university campus above the words \u201cColumbia\u2019s biggest antisemites\u201d, the New York Times reported.The photographs, according to the protesters, were lifted from a \u201csecure and private\u201d student portal at Columbia\u2019s school of international and public affairs (Sipa).The Times reported that the walkout was planned and peaceful, with those leaving almost halfway through Clinton\u2019s two-hour lecture, attended by about 300 students, joining several dozen other demonstrators in the lobby of the school.They were demanding \u201cimmediate legal support for affected students\u201d and \u201ca commitment to student safety, well being and privacy\u201d, according to the Times.\n\nHospitals in northern Gaza are acting as places of shelter for about 117,000 Palestinian people displaced from their homes since the war began, ActionAid said. Meanwhile, the areas surrounding hospitals have come under bombardment and at least 73 healthcare workers have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, the charity said.\n\nWithout food and water, fuel to cook with, clothes or hygiene products, conditions are becoming unbearable.\n\nRiham Jafari, communications and advocacy coordinator at ActionAid Palestine, said:\n\nIf fuel runs out in Gaza, it will be an unimaginable catastrophe for babies on incubators and those in intensive care units relying on ventilators. Instead of being a place where people needing urgent care are treated, hospitals have become a place where patients are sent to morgues, rather than discharged.\n\nHospitals in Gaza are reaching \u201cbreaking point\u201d because they are running \u201cdangerously low\u201d on fuel, putting the lives of newborn babies in incubators at grave risk, an international charity has warned. The main generator for the Indonesian hospital \u2013 one of the main hospitals in the north of Gaza \u2013 went out of service on Wednesday night, according to ActionAid.Hospital staff are now having to rely on a secondary generator that can service only some parts of the hospital, as they continue to receive an influx of patients from the nearby Jabalia refugee camp, which was bombed on both Tuesday and Wednesday, it said.A youth volunteer at Dar al-Shifa hospital \u2013 the largest medical facility in Gaza \u2013 told the charity that the hospital\u2019s incubator department could be forced to go out of service because of the lack of fuel.\n\nMore than 45 incubators just in al-Shifa Hospital could stop. And these newborn babies could simply [die] ... Because they need special care. These [babies] in incubators with an age of 42-45 weeks of pregnancy, days old, are [at] threat of [dying].\n\nMore British citizens crossed into Egypt from Gaza on ThursdayBritish nationals have been able to get out of Gaza through the Rafah crossing for a second day, the UK Foreign Office has confirmed. A statement from the FCDO said:\n\nWe can confirm that more British nationals have been able to cross into Egypt from Gaza via the Rafah crossing today.\n\nWe continue to work with Egyptian and Israeli authorities to support all those seeking to leave in the coming days.\n\nAbout 200 Britons in Gaza have registered with the authorities, PA reported. The UK has provided the Israeli and Egyptian authorities with a list of British nationals and their dependants, prioritising by medical vulnerability. The total number is thought to be in the low hundreds.Downing Street confirmed that two UK aid workers were among those to make it through the Rafah crossing on Wednesday.Labour frontbencher Jess Phillips warned that Britons were not getting out quickly enough, as she criticised the UK government\u2019s diplomatic efforts as not having \u201cmuch sway\u201d.First UK nationals leave Gaza via Rafah crossing, says Foreign Office\n\nIsrael\u2019s top military commander has said his country\u2019s forces have surrounded Gaza City on three sides and that Israeli troops are operating inside the city. Describing fierce fighting, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, the Israel Defence Forces chief of staff, said:\n\n[Israeli forces] are in the heart of northern Gaza, operating in Gaza City, surrounding it.\n\nIn an apparent warning to the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, with whom the IDF has been engaged in daily cross-border exchanges, Halevi added that \u201cless than half the Israeli air force\u201d was involved in airstrikes on Gaza with \u201cmost of its force ready, with bombs loaded should the need arise to attack on other fronts\u201d.Halevi was speaking before a speech by Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut on Friday, the first public remarks he has made since Hamas\u2019s surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals were massacred.Israel and Hezbollah continued to exchange fire on Thursday across the Lebanese border, with a rocket fired from Lebanon hitting a house in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. Hezbollah also claimed it has used two drones to target Israeli forces.\n\nHere are some of the latest images sent over the newswires from the Rafah crossing, where hundreds more foreigners and dual nationals fled Gaza for Egypt today. A total of 400 foreign passport holders as well as 60 severely wounded Palestinians were due to cross by the end of Thursday, Wael Abu Mohsen, a spokesperson for the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing said.A list of those approved to travel on Thursday showed hundreds of US citizens and 50 Belgians along with smaller numbers from various European, Arab, Asian and African countries, AFP reported.Egypt said it eventually plans to help evacuate 7,000 foreigners through the Rafah crossing. The evacuation marks a fraction of the 2.4 million people trapped in Gaza under weeks of bombardment.People at a gate to enter the Rafah border crossing to Egypt in the southern Gaza Strip.

Photograph: Said Khatib/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt least 27 people were killed in a blast near a UN school in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, the Palestinian health ministry said. AFP footage showed several casualties as crowds of people rushed to help them.The Guardian has not been able to verify the death toll. The Hamas-run ministry has blamed an Israeli strike. There was no immediate comment from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which runs the school.Farther south, an Israeli strike hit a residential building in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza earlier today, AP reported, citing a Gaza civil defence spokesperson. At least 15 people have been killed, the spokesperson said.\n\nIsrael could allow fuel into Gaza if hospitals run out, says IDF commanderThe chief of staff of Israel Defence Forces (IDF) was asked about fuel supplies to Gaza during a televised appearance on Thursday.\u201cWe have not brought fuel in to this point,\u201d Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said.\n\nFor more than a week now, they have been telling us that \u2018tomorrow the fuel in hospitals will run out\u2019. So far it has not run out.\n\nIsrael has barred all fuel shipments from entering Gaza since the war began, accusing Hamas of hoarding fuel and diverting it for military use. Hospitals in the Palestinian territory have been increasingly raising alarms about their own electricity supplies waning. On Wednesday, Palestinian health authorities said the only hospital offering cancer treatment in the Gaza Strip was forced to go out of service after running out of fuel.Halevi said Israel is closely monitoring the situation in Gaza and believes the hospitals still have enough to operate. He added:\n\nWe will watch for when that day arrives. Fuel will be transferred, with monitoring, to the hospitals. We will do everything needed to ensure that it will not reach Hamas infrastructures, that it will not end up serving war aims but the real needs of treating the sick.\n\nBut Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, said in a press briefing that the government had not \u201cmade any decision about transferring fuel\u201d to Gaza. He told reporters:\n\nI haven\u2019t given any (such) instruction and the war cabinet has not authorised any decision.\n\nThai officials held talks with Hamas in Iran last week in an effort to secure the release of the 22 Thai people taken hostage during its attack on Israel. Officials, who held a two-hour meeting with Hamas in Tehran on 26 October, were told that the Thai hostages would be released at \u201cthe right time\u201d, and they were being looked after, according to Areepen Uttarasin, a lead negotiator.Thousands of Thais work in Israel\u2019s agricultural sector, and the Israeli government has said they make up the biggest group of foreign people killed or missing in the Hamas attacks.A total of 1,400 people were killed and more than 230 taken hostage during the violence on 7 October. Among them were 32 Thais who were killed, 22 who were abducted and 19 injured, the Thai government has said. Four remain in hospital. The Israeli government has said it believes that more people \u2013 up to 54 \u2013 could be being held captive.Thousands of Thai people who were working in Israel have been evacuated on government flights since the fighting began. Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/APAreepen, who led the three-person team that went to Tehran, said he asked for the release of the Thai hostages and emphasised their innocence.\u201cThey assured me that they were taking good care of them, but they couldn\u2019t tell me the release date \u2026 They were waiting for the right time\u201d he said, adding that after the talks the Thai team \u2013 who are all Muslims \u2013 prayed with the Hamas representatives.\n\nThey acknowledged our concerns because they know that Thailand has offered kindness and benefits to the Muslim community \u2026 They respect Thailand.", "screenshotUrl": null}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/americans-evacuated-gaza-strip-egypt", "loadedUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/americans-evacuated-gaza-strip-egypt", "loadedDomain": "theguardian.com", "referrer": "https://www.theguardian.com", "startUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com", "depth": 1, "title": "Biden says 74 Americans with dual citizenship evacuated from Gaza", "softTitle": "Biden says 74 Americans with dual citizenship evacuated from Gaza", "date": "2023-11-02T18:28:06.000Z", "author": ["Reuters"], "publisher": "the Guardian", "copyright": "2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies", "description": "The evacuees were able to cross from the Gaza Strip into Egypt, the US president said on Thursday", "lang": "en", "canonicalLink": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/americans-evacuated-gaza-strip-egypt", "tags": [], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b1cb26f7fd56d618b6e47a718ab2ea58dd9741/0_219_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df7aa33e72f4fbda9278f7d4e41c571b", "videos": [], "links": [{"text": "Joe Biden", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden"}, {"text": "start leaving ", "href": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-says-american-citizens-will-be-able-exit-gaza-starting-wednesday-2023-11-01/"}, {"text": "a narrow strip under Israeli bombardment", "href": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-says-israels-strikes-refugee-camp-kill-more-than-195-people-2023-11-02/"}, {"text": "Gaza", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza"}, {"text": "Israel", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel"}, {"text": "Hamas", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas"}], "text": "The United States has been able to get 74 Americans with dual citizenship out of the Gaza Strip, president Joe Biden said at the White House on Thursday, one day after evacuees began crossing into Egypt.\n\n\u201cGood news, we got out today 74 American folks, dual citizens,\u201d the president told reporters in the Oval Office at the start of a meeting with the president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader.\n\nBiden had said US citizens would be able to start leaving Gaza on Wednesday, a narrow strip under Israeli bombardment.\n\nFurther details were not immediately available on who had been able to leave Gaza and when.\n\nBiden has thrown his support behind Israel -

No, no, no. Someone is going to get punched in the face.\u201d\n\nIn a statement sent to the Guardian, the White House deputy press secretary, Andrew Bates, called Watters\u2019 remarks \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said: \u201cFox News owes an apology to every single viewer for this sickening attack on the rights and dignity of their fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nIsrael says more than 1,400 people were killed and more than 5,400 injured when Hamas launched surprise attacks on 7 October. More than 240 hostages were taken. According to the Gaza health ministry Israeli strikes have killed more than 9,000. The same source says nearly 24,000 Palestinians have been injured.\n\nIn the US, amid protest and counter-protest, instances of posters of hostages taken by Hamas being removed from public display have been widely reported.\n\nOn Wednesday, Watters also said: \u201cI want to say something about Arab Americans and about the Muslim world. We \u2013 and when I say we I mean the west and western technology \u2013 have created the Middle East. We made them rich. We got that oil out of the ground, our military protects all of these oil shipments flying around the world, making them rich. We fund their military. We respect their kings. We kill their terrorists. OK? But we\u2019ve had it. We\u2019ve had it with them!\u201d\n\nBates said: \u201cThese hateful lies about \u2018Arab Americans and \u2026 the Muslim world\u2019 highlight the urgency of President Biden\u2019s work to ensure hate has no safe harbor in America, and why he committed to the first national anti-Islamophobia strategy in our history.\u201d\n\nBates also pointed to a killing in Plainfield, Illinois, in which Wadea Al-Fayoume, aged six, was stabbed to death in an attack his mother survived. The family\u2019s landlord has been charged with murder and a hate crime. Prosecutors said the accused, who has pleaded not guilty, \u201clisten[ed] to conservative talk radio on a regular basis\u201d, \u201chated Muslims\u201d and was obsessed with the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nA family friend said the attacker shouted \u201cyou Muslims have to die\u201d and \u201cyou are killing our kids in Israel. You Palestinians don\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d\n\nBates said Watters\u2019 \u201c \u2026 unacceptable remarks come just weeks after the heartbreaking killing of a six-year-old Palestinian American child, and during a spike in threats against Muslim and Arab Americans.\n\n\u201cFox News owes an apology to every single viewer for this sickening attack on the rights and dignity of their fellow Americans. President Biden will always stand up against Islamophobia, antisemitism and all forms of hate.

We did all the preliminary checks before we decided to fire a shell into a house. And then we went from house to house to free the hostages. And that\u2019s how the fighting was until the evening. In the kibbutz and in the streets.\n\n\u201cI realised that as soon as people heard the rumbling of the tanks, they suddenly had a moment of security. The moment that is etched in my memory is that I am driving on the roads and realise that I am going to enter an Israeli community where there are cowards who had taken advantage of the holiday to enter the community, who killed, butchered, and kidnapped elderly children and babies\u201d.\n\nHabaka\u2019s death, reportedly while his tank was supporting an advance, came as more details emerged of the bitter nature of the fighting in Gaza, with Hamas and Israeli soldiers fighting at close quarters and Hamas claiming it had dropped drone munitions on Israeli troops.\n\nIn one incident, Israeli troops fought a three-hour-long battle against dozens of Hamas fighters who had ambushed them.\n\nAccording to reports of the ambush, about 30 Hamas gunmen emerged from tunnels equipped with anti-tank missiles and tried to get into Israeli armoured personnel carriers but failed.\n\nIsraeli troops are advancing on Gaza City along three main routes \u2013 from the north-east, from the north-west along the Mediterranean coast, and from the south after reaching the territory\u2019s main north-south highway. Israeli officials have provided only vague statements about troop movements.\n\nAirstrikes on Tuesday and Wednesday destroyed apartment buildings in the Jabalia refugee camp near Gaza City. The number of dead and wounded remains unknown. Israel said the strikes killed militants and demolished Hamas tunnels.\n\nPalestinian militants fired anti-tank missiles, set off explosive devices and hurled grenades at Israeli troops during an overnight battle, the Israeli military said on Thursday. It said soldiers returned fire and called in artillery as well as strikes from a helicopter and a naval ship. The report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nCasualties on both sides are expected to rise as Israeli troops advance toward the dense residential neighbourhoods of Gaza City.", "screenshotUrl": null}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/nov/02/donald-trump-jr-trial-latest-eric-testimony-fraud-case", "loadedUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/nov/02/donald-trump-jr-trial-latest-eric-testimony-fraud-case", "loadedDomain": "theguardian.com", "referrer": "https://www.theguardian.com", "startUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com", "depth": 1, "title": "Eric Trump testifies \u2018I don\u2019t recall\u2019 when asked about involvement in Trump Organization valuation", "softTitle": "Eric Trump testifies \u2018I don\u2019t recall\u2019 when asked about involvement in Trump Organization valuation", "date": "2023-11-02T18:27:11.000Z", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maya-yang,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-aratani"], "publisher": "the Guardian", "copyright": "2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies", "description": "Prosecutors ask Eric Trump about financial statements and executives who cited calls with him for valuation, but he testifies he doesn\u2019t remember conversation", "lang": "en", "canonicalLink": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/nov/02/donald-trump-jr-trial-latest-eric-testimony-fraud-case", "tags": [], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcf6bb56003bd07ea7cf0fc59270e77723d5a9da/104_211_3144_1887/master/3144.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d40d66c08ef0677a59cdba8057f3b05b", "videos": [], "links": [{"text": "<div class=\"dcr-1kz62i8\"><gu-island name=\"RelativeTime\" priority=\"enhancement\" deferuntil=\"visible\" props=\"{&quot;then&quot;:1698949492000}\" config=\"{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}\"><time datetime=\"2023-11-02T18:24:52.000Z\" title=\"Thursday, 2 November 2023 at 18:24 Coordinated Universal Time\">14m ago</time></gu-island></div><div class=\"dcr-3ljij1\">Eric Trump testimony continues</div>", "href": "?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with:block-6543e8f98f08d1827a66ac1e#block-6543e8f98f08d1827a66ac1e"}, {"text": "<div class=\"dcr-1kz62i8\"><gu-island name=\"RelativeTime\" priority=\"enhancement\" deferuntil=\"visible\" props=\"{&quot;then&quot;:1698946927000}\" config=\"{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}\"><time datetime=\"2023-11-02T17:42:07.000Z\" title=\"Thursday, 2 November 2023 at 17:42 Coordinated Universal Time\">1h ago</time></gu-island></div><div class=\"dcr-3ljij1\">Trump calls judge &apos;fraudster&apos;

Lawyers for the New York attorney general quizzed the brothers about their knowledge of the financial statements that prosecutors argue prove that the Trumps were instrumental in a scheme to inflate the family\u2019s perceived wealth for financial gain.\u201cAgain, for purposes of accounting, I relied upon the accountants,\u201d Donald Trump Jr, the former president\u2019s eldest son, told the court.\u201cI never had anything to do with the statements of financial condition,\u201d Eric Trump, Donald Jr\u2019s younger brother, testified.For the full story, click here:\n\nDonald Trump has lashed out at the judge overseeing the ongoing civil fraud case. In a fiery post on Truth Social, Trump called Arthur Engoron \u201cthe fraudster, not me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is just doing this out of his personal \u2018Hatred of TRUMP,\u2019 his love of the publicity that this case is getting him, & his lack of respect for the Appeals Court (He is in total violation of their order ending much of this Witch Hunt right now. He refuses to do what they say he must!).\u201d\n\n\u201cEngoron is a wacko who is having a great time endlessly sanctioning, fining, & pushing around \u2018TRUMP,\u2019 hurting my very good children, & working to damage & defame me for purposes of Interfering with the 2024 Presidential Election, all this while never admonishing our failed & corrupt Attorney General, whose \u201cStar Witness\u201d admitted he lied, & that I did NOT tell him to inflate values, a total reversal. Their whole case was based on this single LOSER, so it should be dismissed!\u201d\n\nThe court is currently on lunch break. We will continue to bring you the latest updates once it resumes. In the meantime, here are more details from Eric Trump\u2019s hearing that just took place.As Eric Trump continued to deny knowledge of the Trump Organization\u2019s statements of financial conditions, NYAG prosecutor Andrew Amer pulled up emails from 2012 & 2013 that suggest he would have know about financial statements, the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Aratani reports.In August 2013, he received an email from Jeff McConney, former controller, that began with \u201cHi Eric, I\u2019m working on your dad\u2019s financial statement...\u201d and McConney references in the spreadsheet with support data for the financial statement a phone call with Eric Trump from this day.Clifford Robert, Eric and Donald Tump Jr\u2019s lawyers, kept objecting for statute of limitation and Eric Trump twice mentioned he was 26 at the time. Eric Trump also kind of just erupted at being asked whether he knew about the statements of financial concerns.\u201cWe\u2019re a major organization\u2026a massive organization. I\u2019m certainly aware that we have financial statements, absolutely,\u201d he said.\n\nAs part of the deal to acquire the North Carolina golf club, a club representative went to New York to review Donald Trump\u2019s financials, Law360\u2019s Stewart Bishop reports. He adds that the Trumps required the representative to sign an NDA. NYAG\u2019s prosecutor Andrew Amer asked Eric Trump, \u201cYou were concerned about him distributing the financial [information] to club members?\u201d Bishop reports.\u201cPossibly, yes,\u201d Eric Trump replied, adding, \u201cI just didn\u2019t want [that] information distributed to 1,200 people, no matter who they were.\u201d He also said he never reviewed his father\u2019s statements of financial condition.\u201cIt\u2019s just not what I do at the company,\u201d Eric Trump said.\u201cI just didn\u2019t want [that] information distributed to 1200 people, no matter who they were,\u201d Eric says.\n\nEric says he never reviewed his father\u2019s statements of financial condition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not what I do at the company,\u201d he says.\u2014 Stewart Bishop (@stewartbishop) November 2, 2023\n\nHe added: \u201cI understood we had financials at the company and we had an accounting department...that would work with outside entities on things like this\u2026 I did not work on the statements of financial condition.\u201d\u201cI understood we had financials at the company and we had an accounting department...that would work with outside entities on things like this,\u201d Eric says.\n\n\"I did not work on the statements of financial condition,\u201d he says.\u2014 Stewart Bishop (@stewartbishop) November 2, 2023\n\nEric says he doesn't recall involvement in 2012 NC golf club purchase offerAndrew Amer, prosecutor for the New York attorney general, asked Eric Trump about the Point Lake & Golf Club in North Carolina which Donald Trump made an offer to purchase in 2012, MSNBC\u2019s Lisa Rubin reports. She adds that a club board member shared with Eric Trump a letter sent to other club members the day before about the potential purchase. Amer moves on to discuss Trump\u2019s Charlotte, NC golf club, which was acquired in 2012. A board member of that club shared with Eric in Jan. 2012 a letter sent to club members on the prior day about the potential purchase of that club by the Trump Org.\u2014 Lisa Rubin (@lawofruby) November 2, 2023\n\nEric Trump recalled that club members had to vote to approve the sale. Rubin also reports that the letter stated, \u201cTrump drafted a few and approved all statements related to that offer.\u201d\u201cEric remembers being a key negotiator of that deal but does not recall whether he was involved in drafting or reviewing the statements made as part of the offer. He says, \u2018It would depend on the statements.\u2019\u201dEric remembers being a key negotiator of that deal but does not recall whether he was involved in drafting or reviewing the statements made as part of the offer. He says, \u201cIt would depend on the statements.\u201d\u2014 Lisa Rubin (@lawofruby) November 2, 2023\n\nDonald Trump Jr is done taking the stand, the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Aratani reports.

We are advancing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in a televised statement Halevi said Israeli troops were \u201cfighting in close quarters against a cruel enemy\u201d.\n\nIn an apparent warning to the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, with whom the IDF has been engaged in daily cross-border exchanges, Halevi added that \u201cless than half the Israeli air force\u201d was involved in airstrikes on Gaza with \u201cmost of its force ready, with bombs loaded should the need arise to attack on other fronts\u201d.\n\nHalevi was speaking before a speech by Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut on Friday, the first public remarks he has made since Hamas\u2019s surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals were massacred.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah continued to exchange fire on Thursday across the Lebanese border, with a rocket fired from Lebanon hitting a house in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. Hezbollah also claimed it has used two drones to target Israeli forces.\n\nHeavy clashes have taken place on the outskirts of Gaza\u2019s urban areas in recent days, in which 18 Israeli soldiers have been killed, including a senior officer, as Israeli troops have faced a series of ambushes in Gaza.\n\nThe latest claims about Israeli operations come as the US president, Joe Biden, suggested a humanitarian \u201cpause\u201d and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is expected back in the region on Friday.\n\nIsrael did not immediately respond to Biden\u2019s remarks, but Netanyahu has previously ruled out a ceasefire.\n\nArab countries, including those allied with the US and at peace with Israel, have expressed mounting unease with the war, with Jordan recalling its ambassador to Israel.\n\nEgypt, meanwhile, said it was preparing to receive \u201cabout 7,000\u201d people representing more than 60 nationalities through the newly opened Rafah crossing that borders Gaza, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday, without specifying a timeline.\n\nOfficials on both sides of the border expected about 400 people to cross on Thursday, with ambulances lined up in expectation of ferrying dozens of casualties to Egyptian hospitals, AFP reported.\n\nA total of 361 foreigners and dual nationals left Gaza on Wednesday after Rafah opened for the first time after more than three weeks of brutal conflict. The evacuees included 31 Austrians, four Italians, five French nationals and several Germans, their governments said.\n\nA trickle of aid has flowed into Gaza from Rafah since the conflict began but until this week no one was allowed to leave the territory. Foreign governments say there are passport holders from 44 countries, as well as 28 agencies, including UN bodies, in Gaza. The United Arab Emirates said it planned to treat 1,000 children but did not specify how they would travel to the Gulf state.\n\nUnicef described \u201chorrific and appalling\u201d scenes of carnage after two rounds of Israeli airstrikes on the Jabalia refugee camp on Tuesday and Wednesday. \u201cPeople\u2019s homes have been levelled, hundreds apparently injured and killed, with many children reportedly among the casualties.\u201d\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry called the strikes a \u201cheinous massacre\u201d that killed 195 people, including seven hostages. Israeli officials said the bombing had killed senior Hamas commanders who sought to shield behind civilians. Israel\u2019s targeting sought to minimise civilian casualties, said Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson. \u201cWe try to build a picture, we try to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is how we do it. It\u2019s war.\u201d\n\nThe current conflict began on 7 October when Hamas launched an onslaught on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people and swept up hundreds more as hostages. The current Israeli estimate of the number of hostages is 242.\n\nIsraeli bombardments have killed at least 8,796 people in Gaza, including 3,648 children, according to the Hamas-run ministry, and left the densely packed population of 2.3 million trapped in a humanitarian disaster with insufficient food, water and medicine.\n\nBiden called for the temporary halt in fighting to facilitate the extraction of hostages. The US president was speaking at a campaign fundraiser in Minneapolis on Wednesday when a woman shouted: \u201cMr President, if you care about Jewish people, as a rabbi, I need you to call for a ceasefire.\u201d Biden replied: \u201cI think we need a pause. A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.\u201d\n\nThe White House has previously called for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d to facilitate aid and evacuations but opposed a ceasefire as benefiting Hamas. Blinken was to hold talks in Israel on Friday and visit nearby countries to seek \u201curgent mechanisms\u201d to reduce regional tensions, his office said.\n\nGermany has said it will ban activities linked to Hamas, already a designated terrorist organisation in the country, as well as those of the pro-Palestinian group Samidoun, which was accused of handing out baked goods in Berlin to celebrate the 7 October attack.\n\nSome Israeli commentators and analysts said that behind the government\u2019s continued rhetoric of vanquishing Hamas and total victory there was a rethink, prompted in part by the prospect of mounting IDF casualties and waning international support for Israel amid carnage in Gaza.\n\n\u201cDefeating Hamas has evolved from an immediate tactical objective into a long-term Israeli strategy, one that will include establishing a security zone, mining the border with Gaza and applying ongoing pressure,\u201d Nadav Eyal wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say, but to me that sounds like another southern Lebanon.\u201d", "screenshotUrl": null}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/tension-escalates-on-lebanese-frontier-amid-hamas-and-hezbollah-barrages", "loadedUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/tension-escalates-on-lebanese-frontier-amid-hamas-and-hezbollah-barrages", "loadedDomain": "theguardian.com", "referrer": "https://www.theguardian.com", "startUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com", "depth": 1, "title": "Tension escalates on Lebanese frontier amid Hamas and Hezbollah barrages", "softTitle": "Tension escalates on Lebanese frontier amid Hamas and Hezbollah barrages", "date": "2023-11-02T18:07:21.000Z", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont"], "publisher": "the Guardian", "copyright": "2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies", "description": "Hamas armed wing the al-Qassam brigades says it hit border town, while Hezbollah claims attack on 19 Israeli positions", "lang": "en", "canonicalLink": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/tension-escalates-on-lebanese-frontier-amid-hamas-and-hezbollah-barrages", "tags": [], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6c2bdc5408b10bcbe69ae834897d3ee0a22871/0_63_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c7c94e919f7de20def4ea8f31c341e2", "videos": [], "links": [{"text": "shelling of the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/we-heard-the-missile-come-tensions-rise-on-israels-northern-border"}, {"text": "Hezbollah", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah"}, {"text": "Israel", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel"}, {"text": "Lebanon", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon"}, {"text": "Hamas", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas"}, {"text": "large-scale evacuation", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/16/it-will-be-worse-than-hamas-order-to-evacuate-strikes-fear-into-north-israel"}, {"text": "firepower", "href": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanons-hezbollah-what-weapons-does-it-have-2023-10-30/"}, {"text": "joined the conflict", "href": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-houthis-enter-mideast-fray-hardening-spillover-fears-2023-10-31/"}], "text": "Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the al-Qassam brigades, said its fighters in southern Lebanon were behind the shelling of the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, where four rockets landed in an industrial area, injuring two people and damaging buildings.\n\nIn a second barrage, Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant group, said it had simultaneously attacked 19 positions in Israel on Thursday evening in the latest escalation on Israel\u2019s northern border.\n\nThursday\u2019s exchanges came before a speech by Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah, in Beirut on Friday that will be closely watched in Israel and across the region. Hezbollah, like Hamas, is a proxy of Iran.\n\nEarlier, Hezbollah said it had used two drones packed with explosives to attack an Israeli army command position in the disputed Shebaa Farms area on the Lebanese-Israeli border.\n\nIt is the first time Hezbollah has acknowledged carrying out an attack against Israeli forces using such drones, and comes a few days after it said for the first time it had used a surface-to-air missile against an Israeli drone.\n\nIn a statement, Hezbollah said the drones filled with \u201ca large quantity of explosives\u201d had attacked the headquarters of the Israeli battalion in the Shebaa Farms area and hit their targets.\n\nIsrael has held the Shebaa Farms, a 15-square-mile area of land, since the 1967 war; Syria and Lebanon claim the area belongs to Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah fighters have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces across the Israeli-Lebanese border since 7 October, when Hamas massacred about 1,400 Israelis, in the deadliest escalation at the frontier since a 2006 war.\n\nThe escalating frictions on the northern border have prompted the large-scale evacuation of the area, where drones can be heard flying constantly over almost deserted towns and communities to the sound of intermittent booms of Israeli artillery fire.\n\nWith the clashes so far mostly contained to the frontier, Hezbollah has used only a fraction of the firepower that Nasrallah has been threatening with Israel for years.\n\nAccording to some estimates, about 50 Hezbollah fighters have died in exchanges in which it has tried to target Israeli positions with anti-tank missiles.\n\nDespite the fighting, analysts have assessed that Israel and Hezbollah are both attempting to avoid the situation escalating out of control, with Hezbollah not yet using its longer-range rockets, of which it has a huge arsenal, but instead targeting positions it can see from across the border.\n\nNasrallah\u2019s anticipated speech \u2013 his first comments since the 7 October attacks \u2013 has raised the stakes, with Israel\u2019s most senior officer warning on Thursday that less than half of its air forces were being used in Gaza, with considerable fire power available for threats on other borders.\n\nLt Gen Herzi Halevi, the head of the Israel Defence Forces, said Israel was ready to fight on several fronts and to \u201cimmediately execute\u201d an operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon if necessary. \u201cIsrael did not start a war against Hezbollah and I do not recommend to anyone to start a war with us,\u201d he said.\n\nA complication, according to some analysts, is that Hezbollah sees any prospect of an Israeli victory against Hamas in Gaza as containing the risk that Israel may turn against it next.\n\n\u201cI believe Hezbollah \u2026 views this conflict as an existential one,\u201d Mohanad Hage Ali, an expert on Lebanon with the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, told Al Jazeera this week. \u201cThey think that if Israel manages to meet its objectives in eradicating Hamas in the Gaza Strip, then they will turn around and deal with what they see as the Hezbollah threat.\u201d\n\nNasrallah is a leading voice in a regional military alliance established by Iran to counter the US and Israel, known as the Axis of Resistance. It includes Shia Iraqi militias who have been firing at US forces in Syria and Iraq, and Houthis from Yemen who have joined the conflict by firing drones at Israel.\n\nWhile Nasrallah has kept out of the public eye, other Hezbollah officials have indicated the group\u2019s combat readiness while not setting any red lines in the conflict with Israel.\n\nThe Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah said Nasrallah was following the situation in Gaza \u201cmoment by moment and hour by hour\u201d and overseeing the battle in Lebanon. As \u201cpart of his management of the battle\u201d, Nasrallah had not until now spoken in public, he said.", "screenshotUrl": null}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/02/donald-trump-jr-day-two-testimony-fraud-trial", "loadedUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/02/donald-trump-jr-day-two-testimony-fraud-trial", "loadedDomain": "theguardian.com", "referrer": "https://www.theguardian.com", "startUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com", "depth": 1, "title": "Donald Trump Jr and brother Eric testify in Trump Organization fraud trial", "softTitle": "Donald Trump Jr and brother Eric testify in Trump Organization fraud trial", "date": "2023-11-02T17:41:55.000Z", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-aratani,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-rushe"], "publisher": "the Guardian", "copyright": "2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies", "description": "Donald Jr says he \u2018relied upon accountants\u2019 for financial statements while Eric says he \u2018never had anything to do\u2019 with them", "lang": "en", "canonicalLink": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/02/donald-trump-jr-day-two-testimony-fraud-trial", "tags": [], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d65996282aed7b23e04c1bb9e59db931b05c99ba/939_65_1727_1036/master/1727.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=16f2d82e5fe943d40dd11dfd9dc5daf2", "videos": [], "links": [{"text": "New York", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york"}, {"text": "decades fighting", "href": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-forbes-rich-list-removed-history/2021/10/06/4dbdfdc8-26a1-11ec-8831-a31e7b3de188_story.html"}, {"text": "demanded an apology", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/12/trump-forbes-magazine-wealthiest-people-list"}, {"text": "400 wealthiest", "href": "https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/"}, {"text": "Letitia James", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/02/letitia-james-new-york-attorney-general-trump-real-estate-trial"}, {"text": "moved to terminate", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/05/donald-trump-accountant-financial-fraud-trial"}], "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s two eldest sons took the stand on Thursday in the family firm\u2019s $250m fraud trial and claimed they relied on accountants and others to make sure their financial records were correct.\n\nLawyers for the New York attorney general quizzed the brothers about their knowledge of the financial statements that prosecutors argue prove the Trumps were instrumental in a scheme to inflate the family\u2019s perceived wealth for financial gain.\n\n\u201cAgain, for purposes of accounting, I relied upon the accountants,\u201d Donald Trump Jr, the former president\u2019s eldest son, told the court.\n\n\u201cI never had anything to do with the statements of financial condition,\u201d Eric Trump, Donald Jr\u2019s younger brother, testified.\n\nProsecutor Colleen Faherty, who questioned Trump Jr, showed the court a series of documents , including an email that a Forbes factchecker sent to the Trump Organization that was eventually forwarded to Trump Jr.\n\nTrump has spent decades fighting with Forbes about the publication\u2019s assessment of his wealth. Last month he demanded an apology after Forbes dropped him from its list of the 400 wealthiest people in the US.\n\nIn the email, Forbes pointed out that the Trump Organization had told the magazine that Trump\u2019s triplex apartment in Trump Tower was about 33,000 sq ft, but Forbes cited documents that showed the apartment was actually just under 11,000 sq ft.\n\n\u201cInsane amount of stuff there in regards to the Forbes inquiry,\u201d Donald Jr wrote to other Trump Organization executives in response to the inquiry.\n\nFaherty then showed a letter the Trump Organization sent to their accounting firm, Mazars USA, which was compiling the organization\u2019s 2016 statement of financial condition.\n\nIn the letter, the Trump Organization had affirmed its responsibility of \u201cfair presentation\u201d in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Donald Jr repeated his assertion that he relied on Mazars to provide them the information and that the accounting firm was \u201cintimately involved\u201d with the preparation of the statement.\n\nMoments after Eric Trump took the stand, he was presented with a spreadsheet from 2013 that included a note from the former Trump controller Jeff McConney that stated he had had a phone call with Eric Trump, presumably about the financial statement. Eric Trump said he did not recall the phone call and said he did not know about the financial statement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I ever saw or worked on the statement of financial condition,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I had any knowledge of it.\n\n\u201cPeople in the company have conversations with you all the time, and you provide them with answers when you can,\u201d said Eric Trump. \u201cI think I was 26 years old,\u201d he added. \u201cI was not aware of it, I never worked on it, and I didn\u2019t know about it until this case came into fruition.\u201d\n\nBut then prosecutor Andrew Amer produced various documents that referenced a statement, including an email McConney sent to Eric Trump on the same day the noted phone call took place.\n\n\u201cHi Eric, I\u2019m working on your dad\u2019s financial statement,\u201d the email began.\n\nAnother email from McConney had the subject line with \u201cF/S\u201d in it, which stands for \u201cfinancial statement\u201d. Amer pointed out that McConney was explicitly asking Eric Trump about the financial statement.\n\n\u201cYou would have understood at the time you received this email that your father had an annual financial statement,\u201d Amer said.\n\nA frustrated Eric Trump quickly answered: \u201cWe\u2019re a major organization, a massive organization. I\u2019m certainly aware that we have financial statements, absolutely.\u201d\n\nDonald Jr and his brother Eric are the first family members to testify in the case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James. Donald Trump will testify on Monday and his daughter Ivanka is expected to take the stand later in the same week.\n\nJames\u2019s investigation found the Trumps cooked their books for decades, inflating Trump\u2019s wealth to obtain loans on better terms.\n\nJames is calling for the Trump Organization to pay back $250m in alleged ill-gotten gains. The court has moved to terminate the Trumps\u2019 business licenses \u2013 a move that would end their ability to do business in the state. That decision is on hold as the Trumps appeal the decision.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that the Trump Organization committed fraud. The trial will determine the penalties he will impose.\n\nIn a statement posted on X, James said: \u201cDonald Trump lied about his net worth on his statements of financial condition to get loans for much better terms than he should have.

Sainte-Marie says she was taken from her biological mother when she was an infant and raised by a white family in the US.\n\nBut last week, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation released a documentary calling into question that narrative and her claims to have Indigenous roots.\n\nIts report left communities in disbelief, and threaten to tarnish Sainte-Marie\u2019s reputation as a cultural icon who fought tirelessly for social justice movements during a career in which she won an Oscar, numerous industry accolades and four honorary doctorates from Canadian universities.\n\nDelia Opekokew, Sainte-Marie\u2019s former lawyer, who is Cree, has disputed the claims and recently signed an affidavit that concludes Sainte-Marie was probably born in Saskatchewan in a private home and soon after was given up for adoption to an American family visiting the area.\n\n\u201cAs an Indigenous woman in the 1960s, I tried to walk proudly, but we faced so much racism and sexism. And so I kept my head down. But when I first heard Buffy sing my heart just erupted with joy. I cried,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhat she sang was so heartfelt. It showed respect for the dignity of Indigenous people. It gave me dignity. And so I raised my head.\u201d\n\nTo underpin her research, Opekokew, the first Indigenous woman admitted to the bar in Ontario and Saskatchewan, conducted multiple interviews in Cree and in English more than two decades ago, including with Emile and Clara Piapot, the couple who adopted Sainte-Marie as an adult into their family under Cree traditional law.\n\nShe also spoke with Noel Starblanket, the former national chief of the National Indian Brotherhood, which later became Assembly of First Nations. She says Starblanket\u2019s account is corroborated by others she has spoken with.\n\nShe criticized what she called the CBC\u2019s \u201cvoyeuristic journalism\u201d that she said had failed to include the importance of oral history and Cree traditions.\n\n\u201cThe CBC did not speak to me as the witness to the oral history. I spoke to the elders and oral history is just as important as written records. And for the purposes of Indigenous history, it\u2019s often more important. They lacked that sense of respect for our way of keeping our history,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just feel awful about that. I feel awful for Buffy and all those in the community that support her.\u201d\n\nIn a written statement in response, Sainte-Marie said she had \u201calways struggled to answer questions about who I am\u201d and had in the past instructed her lawyer to discover information about her background. She said her \u201cgrowing-up mother\u201d had told her many things \u201cincluding that I was adopted and that I was native but there was no documentation as was common for Indigenous children born in the 1940s.\u201d. She added: \u201cI may not know where I was born, but I know who I am.\u201d\n\nThe allegations broadcast by the CBC, including a birth certificate for Sainte-Marie issued by the state of Massachusetts, as well as posts on social media by Sainte-Marie\u2019s son, have unleashed a torrent of vitriol.\n\n\u201cHow much ugliness this has brought upon my aunt and our family is shameful,\u201d Ntawnis Piapot, whose grandparents adopted Sainte-Marie under Cree traditions, wrote on Facebook. She says the report has caused \u201cpain and suffering\u201d among her relatives.\n\nOpekokew, who was taken from her family to attend residential school, says the broadcaster should have better considered the immense harms the reporting would have on those also taken from their families and survivors of sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do that kind of stories without preparing the possible possibility that you might be triggering many people. And it triggered thousands of people, including myself.\n\nThe CBC, which previously outlined its criteria for reporting \u201cpretendian\u201d stories, said it reached out to members of the Piapot family, but received no response. The CBC also says it reached out to the acting chief of Piapot First Nation to arrange a visit to the community, but the chief declined. The broadcaster added it \u201cdoes not dispute the Piapot family adopted Buffy Sainte-Marie as an adult, nor does it dispute the validity of that traditional adoption\u201d.\n\nOver the weekend, the Indigenous Women\u2019s Collective said in a statement that after weighing the claims against Sainte-Marie, it concluded the singer had engaged in a \u201cgreat deception\u201d that allowed her to benefit from a \u201cvery deliberate and false narrative that misled thousands of Indigenous youth, adults, and most tragically, Indigenous survivors of colonial harm\u201d.\n\nThe group singled out Sainte-Marie\u2019s previous statements that she was a survivor of the Sixties Scoop \u2013 a notorious period in Canadian history in which Indigenous children were forcibly taken from their homes and sent to live with white families. While the CBC documentary notes the Scoop began a decade after Sainte-Marie was born, adoptions into white families still took place.\n\nThe Indigenous Women\u2019s Collective also called for Sainte-Marie to be stripped of her 2018 Indigenous Album of the Year award at the Junos, a prestigious Canadian music award show.\n\nBut others say that Sainte-Marie\u2019s history and career highlight the complexity and tangled nature of identity. Kim Wheeler, a Manitoba-based writer who recently worked as a producer on a musical celebration of Sainte-Marie, says the Juno category Indigenous artist of the year largely exists because of the singer\u2019s trailblazing career.\n\n\u201cBuffy inspired so many of the performers at that show. She was their north star. They said without her, they might not have pursued careers in music. Buffy showed them that if she could succeed, so could they,\u201d she said.\n\nWheeler, who is of Anishinaabe and Mohawk descent, says Sainte-Marie\u2019s appearances on Sesame Street were powerful to see as a child. \u201cJust watching her on the show, we knew we could be more than what society told us we were.\u201d\n\nThroughout her career, Sainte-Marie fought to to ensure Indigenous peoples were included in casting decisions and given opportunities they had long been denied, says Wheeler.

Filed last year in California, that lawsuit alleges sexual battery and assault of a minor relating to his relationship with Julia Holcomb Misley, then 16, during a three-year period during the same decade.\n\nBellino was a teenager working on a fashion show in Manhattan in the summer of 1975 when a friend arranged for her to meet Aerosmith at a nearby hotel, according to Rolling Stone. The lawsuit alleges Tyler sexually assaulted her twice during the only day they were together, once in a phone box into which, she says, he pushed her before groping her and rubbing against her, and later at the hotel where she alleges he forcibly kissed her and grinded against her again.\n\nThe publication said a lawyer for Tyler, who was aged about 27 at the time of the alleged assaults, and representatives for the band did not immediately return a request for comment. The Guardian has separately contacted Tyler\u2019s management company and PR representatives.\n\nBellino\u2019s lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages, cites \u201cgender-motivated violence\u201d as the cause of action, per Rolling Stone.\n\nAlthough the alleged incidents occurred more than half a century ago, the lawsuit claims Bellino \u201chas suffered and will continue to suffer, great pain of mind and body, severe and permanent emotional distress, physical manifestations of emotional distress, embarrassment, humiliation, physical, personal & psychological injuries\u201d.\n\nIt also claims she was \u201chospitalized and medicated as a result of the incident\u201d and still takes medication now \u201cto cope with the sexual assault and has suffered long-term physical injury associated with the trauma\u201d.\n\nThe alleged phone-box assault, Bellino says, took place when the band and several members of their entourage left Manhattan\u2019s Warwick hotel for a walk along Sixth Avenue. While walking, she says, she asked Tyler a question about a song lyric that frustrated him, and he forced her into the kiosk.\n\n\u201cWhile holding her captive, Tyler stuck his tongue down her throat, and put his hands upon her body, her breasts, her buttocks, and her genitals, moving and removing clothing and pinning her against the wall of the phone booth,\u201d the lawsuit alleges, according to Rolling Stone.\n\n\u201cAs Tyler was mauling and groping plaintiff, he was humping her pretending to have sex with plaintiff. Others stood by outside the phone booth laughing and as passersby watched and witnessed, nobody in the entourage intervened.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit further states: \u201cTyler\u2019s penis was erect and it was evident to her as he rubbed it against her that he was not wearing underwear and wearing thin pants.\u201d She says she freed herself by raising her knee and pulling on Tyler\u2019s hair and ran from the phone booth \u201cin shock and fear\u201d.\n\nBellino said she was relying on her friend for transportation and accompanied the band back to the hotel, where the alleged second assault took place. She says Tyler forcibly kissed and grinded against her near the bar area, and then disappeared to his room, stating he would call down for her.\n\nWhen the call came, she alleges, she was so afraid that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk and was paralyzed\u201d, before running for the exit and being \u201cflung\u201d into a taxi by a doorman who saw her distress.\n\nThe article does not say why Bellino did not come forward with the allegations for almost 50 years.\n\nThe case has parallels with the allegations contained in the California lawsuit in which Misley, who says she became Tyler\u2019s lover when she was 16, says he used his influence as a prominent star to \u201cgroom, manipulate, exploit, [and] sexually assault\u201d her over many months.\n\nHis sway extended to persuading Misley\u2019s parents to allow him to become her legal guardian so he could take her across state lines without fear of arrest, it is alleged. Tyler denied Misley\u2019s allegations of assault and battery, but not that he had sex with her.\n\nThat case was filed under a state law that temporarily extended the statute of limitations for adults to take legal action on sexual abuse they suffered as children.\n\n* Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Clinton had already left.\n\nThe Democratic former presidential candidate has taken a strong pro-Israel stance since the conflict erupted last month, last week denouncing those calling for a ceasefire as not understanding Hamas during a discussion at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute.\n\nColumbia is among the universities that have become a flashpoint for protests over the war, with students on both sides angrily denouncing the other for the escalating violence and growing number of deaths.\n\nA rally at the campus last month called by National Students for Justice in Palestine was part of a \u201cday of resistance\u201d at Israel\u2019s military response to the attacks by Hamas, and also attracted a sizeable group of pro-Israel protesters.\n\nThe pro-Palestinian students whose faces were shown on screens near the campus last week had signed a declaration in support of \u201cPalestinian resistance against over 75 years of Israeli settler-colonialism and apartheid\u201d. The statement said in part: \u201cThe weight of responsibility for the war and casualties undeniably lies with the Israeli extremist government.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to the Guardian, a Columbia spokesperson said the appearance of vehicles displaying students\u2019 photographs was \u201cconcerning\u201d.\n\n\u201cMany individuals, including students across several schools, have been subject to these attacks by third parties. This includes disturbing incidents in which trucks have circled the Columbia campus displaying and publicizing the names and photos of Arab, Muslim and Palestinian students,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe University\u2019s overriding priority is the safety and security of its students and community. The University and Sipa take this responsibility very seriously \u2013 and this includes speaking out against doxxing, a dangerous form of intimidation, as unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe university last week unveiled a new taskforce to counter student doxxing \u2013 the intentional publication online of a person\u2019s private information, usually with malicious intent \u2013 and to enhance student safety.\n\nThe Columbia spokesperson also said the protest \u201cwas not targeted at the secretary and dean\u2019s class specifically, but all Sipa classes happening Wednesday afternoon\u201d. They noted its organizers called it an \u201cact of solidarity not tied to any political ideals or figures\u201d.\n\nClinton, 76, Barack Obama\u2019s first-term secretary of state from 2009-2013, began teaching her class, called Inside the Situation Room, at the start of the academic year in September. Some expressed frustration at the logistical impact of her presence, complaining that about 500 students in one of Columbia\u2019s most popular computer science classes were evicted \u201cto put up a nice stage for [Clinton\u2019s] high-profile lecture series\u201d.\n\nYarhi-Milo interrupted one of Clinton\u2019s first lectures to allow students with cellphone cameras to take photographs of their celebrity teacher. \u201cThis is like the paparazzi,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nAnnouncing her appointment in February, the then Columbia president, Lee Bollinger, said Clinton\u2019s class would explore \u201cfundamental questions\u201d about how to advance the renewal of democracy and foster more engagement with women and youth across the US and the world.", "screenshotUrl": null}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/mobile/2014/may/29/the-guardian-for-mobile-and-tablet", "loadedUrl": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guardian&referrer=adjust_reftag%3Dcn6Y4DSNm27kR%26utm_source%3DOn%2Bplatform%26utm_campaign%3DEditorial%26utm_content%3DStandfirst%2Blink", "loadedDomain": "theguardian.com", "referrer": "https://www.theguardian.com", "startUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com", "depth": 1, "title": "Apps on Google Play", "softTitle": "Apps on Google Play", "date": "2014-05-29", "author": [], "publisher": null, "copyright": null, "favicon": "//www.gstatic.com/android/market_images/web/favicon_v3.ico", "description": "World news, sport, business & opinion.

Highly recommend!Did you find this helpful?Well ever since the AP's app shot itself in both feet, I've been using the Guardian's and so far mostly everything seems fine with the transition. One very annoying thing though is in the main list of articles, there'll be something in a headline that is nowhere to be found in the actual article. Kind of frustrating to be lured into reading something when the actual subject matter doesn't exist. Please stop posting headlines with no articles to back them up, it's a very annoying waste of my timeDid you find this helpful?It works extremely well. The news has a different viewpoint than American apps. I read this an the New York times daily. I find the guardian more informative.

But more importantly he was a wonderful dad and my life partner for 18 years,\u201d wrote King.\n\n\u201cAdy fought for the 24/7 care he needed to be home with us until the end of his life,\u201d King added, thanking Barkan\u2019s caregivers and \u201ctheir labor and care, which allowed us to live as a family through Ady\u2019s health challenges\u201d.\n\n\u201cEveryone should have that chance,\u201d she said.\n\nBarkan was first diagnosed with ALS in 2016 at the age of 32, the healthcare advocate wrote in a 2022 piece for the Guardian.\n\nThe progressive degenerative illness targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and the brain. The disease is often terminal, with those diagnosed usually having a three to five year survival rate.\n\nBarkan lost his ability to walk and was unable to eat, speak or breathe on his own without the use of a ventilator machine.\n\nSince his diagnosis, Barkan said that he became acutely aware with the issues regarding the US healthcare system, especially for those dealing with a serious illness.\n\n\u201cI knew that US healthcare was broken before my diagnosis, but having a serious illness clarified the cruelty of our profit-driven system,\u201d Barkan wrote.\n\nHe was only able to pay for his round-the-clock care after suing his insurance company in federal court, and with the help of friends who covered part of his care.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a team of lawyers, an experienced activist, and the generosity of friends and strangers to get the healthcare you need to survive,\u201d Barkan wrote.\n\nBarkan used his experience to advocate for universal healthcare and a complete overhaul of the US healthcare system.\n\nBarkan first went viral in 2017 after confronting the former Arizona senator Jeff Flake about Flake\u2019s support of tax cuts that would cause healthcare costs to soar, an encounter that was filmed by organizer Liz Jaff.\n\n\u201cThink about the legacy that you will have for my son and your grandchildren, if you take your principles and turn them into votes,\u201d Barkan said to Flake.\n\n\u201cYou can save my life,\u201d Barkan said.\n\nIn 2018, Barkan co-founded the non-profit Be A Hero, an organization working to expand access to healthcare amid other political priorities. Jamila Headley, the organization\u2019s co-executive director celebrated Barkan\u2019s life and work in a post to X.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a world without [Ady Barkan] learning, strategizing, fighting, and laughing alongside me but his work lives on in [Be A Hero] and the powerful movement of patients we are building,\u201d wrote Headley.\n\nHis activism was subsequently documented in the 2021 documentary Not Going Quietly, which showed his May 2019 testimony to Congress about his family\u2019s struggles to afford his care.\n\nSpeaking through a computerized device, Barkan told lawmakers that his family paid $9,000 a month out-of-pocket to cover the remainder of his care.\n\n\u201cWe are cobbling together the money, from friends and family and supporters all over the country,\u201d he said to Congress. \u201cBut this is an absurd way to run a healthcare system.\u201d\n\nBarkan is survived by his wife Rachael and their two children.", "screenshotUrl": null}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/02/tupac-shakur-murder-las-vegas-nevada", "loadedUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/02/tupac-shakur-murder-las-vegas-nevada", "loadedDomain": "theguardian.com", "referrer": "https://www.theguardian.com", "startUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com", "depth": 1, "title": "Suspect in 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur pleads not guilty", "softTitle": "Suspect in 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur pleads not guilty", "date": "2023-11-02T18:03:12.000Z", "author": ["Associated Press"], "publisher": "the Guardian", "copyright": "2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies", "description": "Duane Keith \u2018Keffe D\u2019 Davis, the only person ever charged with a crime in the case, entered his plea before a judge on Thursday", "lang": "en", "canonicalLink": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/02/tupac-shakur-murder-las-vegas-nevada", "tags": [], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dfed78f7ec8af8caff0d1ed2eb1db7fbe454d0/0_814_2744_1646/master/2744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dfc57599a8d39530c09df6c920a40649", "videos": [], "links": [{"text": "Tupac Shakur", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2pac"}, {"text": "Las Vegas", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas"}], "text": "A former southern California street gang leader pleaded not guilty Thursday to orchestrating a drive-by shooting that killed Tupac Shakur in 1996 in Las Vegas.\n\nDuane Keith \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, the only person still alive who was in the car from which shots were fired and the only person ever charged with a crime in the case, stood in shackles before the Clark county district judge Tierra Jones.\n\nSpecial public defenders Robert Arroyo and Charles Cano represented Davis in court Thursday. On Wednesday, Davis lost his bid to hire defense attorney Ross Goodman. Two weeks ago, Goodman had said prosecutors lacked witnesses and key evidence, including a gun or vehicle, from the killing 27 years ago.\n\nBefore entering his plea Thursday, Davis stood in dark-blue jail garb and answered a short series of questions, telling the judge that he had attended \u201ca year in college\u201d, was not under the influence of any drugs, medication or alcohol, and that he understood he had been charged with murder.\n\nDavis, 60, is from Compton, California. He was arrested 29 September outside a home in suburban Henderson, Nevada, where Las Vegas police had served a search warrant on 17 July, drawing renewed attention to one of hip-hop music\u2019s most enduring mysteries. Davis remains jailed without bail, did not testify before the grand jury that indicted him, and declined from jail to speak with the Associated Press.\n\nThe indictment alleges Davis obtained a gun and provided it to someone in the back seat of a Cadillac before the car-to-car gunfire that mortally wounded Shakur and wounded rap music mogul Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight at an intersection just off the Las Vegas Strip. Shakur died a week later. He was 25.\n\nKnight, now 58, is in prison in California, serving a 28-year sentence for the murder of a Compton businessman in 2015. He has not responded to messages through his attorneys seeking comment about Davis\u2019s arrest.\n\nProsecutors allege that Shakur\u2019s killing in Las Vegas was the result of competition between east coast members of a Bloods gang sect and west coast groups of a Crips sect, including Davis, for dominance in a musical genre dubbed \u201cgangsta rap\u201d.\n\nThe grand jury was told the 7 September 1996 shooting in Las Vegas was retaliation for a brawl hours earlier at a Las Vegas Strip casino involving Shakur and Davis\u2019s nephew, Orlando \u201cBaby Lane\u201d Anderson.\n\nProsecutors told a grand jury that Davis implicated himself in the killing in multiple interviews and a 2019 tell-all memoir that described his life leading a Crips sect in Compton. Davis has said he obtained a .40-caliber handgun and handed it to Anderson, a member of Davis\u2019s gang, in the back seat of a Cadillac, though he didn\u2019t identify Anderson as the shooter.\n\nAnderson, then 22, denied involvement in Shakur\u2019s killing and died two years later in a shooting in his hometown of Compton. The other back seat passenger and the driver of the Cadillac are also dead.\n\nIn his book, Davis wrote that he told authorities in 2010 what he knew of the killings of Shakur and gang rival Notorious BIG, whose legal name was Christopher Wallace, to protect himself and 48 of his Southside Compton Crips gang associates from prosecution and the possibility of life sentences in prison.\n\nWallace, also known as Biggie Smalls, was shot and killed in Los Angeles in March 1997, six months after Shakur\u2019s death.\n\nShakur is largely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time. He had five No 1 albums, was nominated for six Grammy awards, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, and received a posthumous star this year on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.", "screenshotUrl": null}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/02/five-takeaways-uk-ai-safety-summit-bletchley-park-rishi-sunak", "loadedUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/02/five-takeaways-uk-ai-safety-summit-bletchley-park-rishi-sunak", "loadedDomain": "theguardian.com", "referrer": "https://www.theguardian.com", "startUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com", "depth": 1, "title": "Five takeaways from UK\u2019s AI safety summit at Bletchley Park", "softTitle": "Five takeaways from UK\u2019s AI safety summit at Bletchley Park", "date": "2023-11-02T16:55:00.000Z", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/danmilmo,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kiran-stacey"], "publisher": "the Guardian", "copyright": "2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies", "description": "Rishi Sunak hails conference as diplomatic coup after it produces international declaration to address AI risks", "lang": "en", "canonicalLink": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/02/five-takeaways-uk-ai-safety-summit-bletchley-park-rishi-sunak", "tags": [], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a27f061c8455c778e969183d3a9d773a7ec155a/0_79_6089_3653/master/6089.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c57cf4d3d93e4d045f62cf3516a5ccba", "videos": [], "links": [{"text": "international declaration", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/01/uk-us-eu-and-china-sign-declaration-of-ais-catastrophic-danger"}, {"text": "Ursula von der Leyen", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/ursula-von-der-leyen"}, {"text": "attended", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/01/elon-musk-calls-ai-one-of-the-biggest-threats-to-humanity-at-summit"}, {"text": "existential fears were being overplayed", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/01/nick-clegg-ai-clamour-similar-moral-panic-video-games"}], "text": "Rishi Sunak has hailed this week\u2019s artificial intelligence summit as a diplomatic breakthrough after it produced an international declaration to address risks with the technology.\n\nHere are five things we have learned from the summit.\n\nThe prime minister spent diplomatic capital convening global leaders, tech executives, academics and civil society figures at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, the base for second world war codebreakers.\n\nThose attending included the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, award-winning computer scientists, executives at all the leading AI companies \u2013 and Elon Musk.\n\nEven if Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden were among the no-shows, the gathering had political and commercial heft.\n\nTino Cu\u00e9llar, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was a \u201cremarkable achievement\u201d in diplomatic terms. This was symbolised by the signing of an international declaration that recognised the need to address risks represented by AI development, backed by more than 25 countries and the EU. France will host the next full-blown AI safety summit in 2024 \u2013 guaranteeing that Sunak\u2019s initiative will live on.\n\nThe White House made clear its power to set the AI agenda this week. Biden issued an executive order requiring tech firms to submit test results for powerful AI systems to the government before they are released to the public. Harris gave a speech about AI in London on day one of the summit and announced the establishment of an AI safety institute, echoing a similar announcement by Biden last week.\n\nThe UK tech secretary, Michelle Donelan, said she was unfazed by the US initiatives, pointing to the fact the majority of cutting-edge AI companies, such as the ChatGPT developer OpenAI, are based in the US. That remark underlined the fact that the US has commercial, as well as political, strength in AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest man attended the summit and brought glitz, as well as distraction, to the gathering. Sunak invited him to Downing Street for a streamed fireside chat and the Tesla CEO\u2019s warning that AI was \u201cone of the biggest threats to humanity\u201d overshadowed more nuanced contributions.\n\nSome guests viewed the attendance of Musk, whose nascent AI venture xAI is nowhere near the scale of the bigger players, as an example of Fomo (fear of missing out). But his presence brought extra attention to the summit.\n\nThe possibility that AI can wipe out humanity \u2013 a view held by less hyperbolic figures than Musk \u2013 remains a divisive one in the tech community. That difference of opinion was not healed by two days of debate in Buckinghamshire.\n\nBut if there is a consensus on risk among politicians, executives and thinkers, then it focuses on the immediate fear of a disinformation glut. There are concerns that elections in the US, India and the UK next year could be affected by malicious use of generative AI.\n\nNick Clegg, president of global affairs at Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta, said this week that existential fears were being overplayed but he was concerned about the immediate threat to democratic polls. \u201cWe have some things which we need to deal with now,\u201d he said.\n\nEvery delegation at Bletchley was keen to claim preeminence in AI regulation, from European diplomats noting they had started the regulatory process four years ago to Americans talking up the power of their new AI safety institute.\n\nWhile the EU is moving closer to passing its AI act, UK officials have made clear they do not think regulation is needed, or even possible at this stage given how fast the industry is moving.\n\nBut most agree on the importance of international summits such as this one, not least to help define the problem different countries are trying to tackle.\n\nOne official said: \u201cWhat we need most of all from the international stage is a panel like the International Panel on Climate Change, which at least establishes a scientific consensus about what AI models are able to do.\u201d", "screenshotUrl": null}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/02/all-we-can-do-now-is-run-away-is-time-up-for-the-sinking-colombian-islands-of-san-bernardo", "loadedUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/02/all-we-can-do-now-is-run-away-is-time-up-for-the-sinking-colombian-islands-of-san-bernardo", "loadedDomain": "theguardian.com", "referrer": "https://www.theguardian.com", "startUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com", "depth": 1, "title": "is time up for the sinking Colombian islands of San Bernardo?", "softTitle": "\u2018All we can do now is run away\u2019: is time up for the sinking Colombian islands of San Bernardo?", "date": "2023-11-02T06:00:31.000Z", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/i-igo-alexander"], "publisher": "the Guardian", "copyright": "2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies", "description": "Islanders on this archipelago live only 2 metres above sea level, while authorities fail to take action as climate change brings oblivion closer each year", "lang": "en", "canonicalLink": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/02/all-we-can-do-now-is-run-away-is-time-up-for-the-sinking-colombian-islands-of-san-bernardo", "tags": [], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9912b5b9d4520113233745af0052cf28dcb469d/0_727_7758_4655/master/7758.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f9349abece6a2d2a48b155fe5e44c57c", "videos": [], "links": [{"text": "low-lying coastal regions ", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/10/small-island-nations-take-high-emitting-countries-to-court-to-protect-the-ocean"}, {"text": "densely populated islands in the world", "href": "https://expotur-eco.com/en/the-most-densely-populated-island/#:~:text=HURTADO%20NDUncategorized-,Santa%20Cruz%20del%20Islote%20is%20the,populated%20island%20in%20the%20world.&text=With%20only%201%2C200%20meters%20in,a%20small%20and%20colorful%20space."}, {"text": "protected natural park", "href": "https://old.parquesnacionales.gov.co/portal/en/ecotourism/caribbean-region/corales-del-rosario-y-de-san-bernardo-national-natural-park/"}, {"text": "rise by up to 30cm by 2050", "href": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/sea-level-rise-1"}, {"text": "changes in sea temperatures, acidity, and marine biodiversity", "href": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/26/its-absolutely-guaranteed-the-best-and-worst-case-scenarios-for-sea-level-rise"}, {"text": "its conditions to be preserved in perpetuity", "href": "https://www.cambioclimaticosanbernardo.com/"}, {"text": "according to a 2019 study", "href": "https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/bitstream/handle/unal/76485/Efectos%20ambientales%20del%20ascenso%20del%20nivel%20medio%20del%20mar.%20Caso%20Isla%20M%c3%bacura..pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y"}, {"text": "A 2014 local government", "href": "https://www.invemar.org.co/documents/10182/14479/2014_Lineamientos_adaptacion_in.pdf/a312edfa-d6d7-40d3-ba0b-72b7ad8e5b23"}, {"text": "natural parks authority", "href": "https://www.parquesnacionales.gov.co/"}], "text": "People on the tiny Colombian island of Santa Cruz del Islote are used to having their sleep disrupted by the gentle lap of waves. But what might sound relaxing and blissful can actually be unnatural and menacing.\n\nRising from bed, islanders feel a splash as their feet touch the floor, and know that their homes have once again been flooded.\n\nSanta Cruz del Islote, part of the San Bernardo archipelago, a few miles off Colombia\u2019s Caribbean coast, is typical of many of the world\u2019s low-lying coastal regions  now at the forefront of the escalating battle against the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very worrying. The tides and sea levels are rising and flooding many homes. We\u2019re worried that our islands are disappearing,\u201d says Adri\u00e1n Caraballo, a young islander and local climate campaigner.\n\nCaraballo recalls wading through ankle-deep water on the streets during one recent flood on Santa Cruz del Islote, which is one of the most densely populated islands in the world.\n\nThe archipelago\u2019s 10 tiny islands are part of a protected natural park and are home to about 1,500 people. They lie amid an intricate web of coral reefs and a dense maze of mangroves at an average of only 2 metres (6ft) above the waterline.\n\nGlobal sea levels are expected to rise by up to 30cm by 2050, threatening the livelihood of San Bernardo\u2019s people, and ultimately the very existence of the islands.\n\nPeople here depend on small-scale artisanal fishing and tourism to survive. Some of the archipelago\u2019s islands have already disappeared, succumbing to the rising waters, and those that remain are affected by erosion and changes in sea temperatures, acidity, and marine biodiversity due to the climate crisis. All this depletes the fish population that many depend on to ply their trade and feed their families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deplorable because, besides the human factor, an important ecological heritage is being lost,\u201d says Juan Manuel D\u00edaz, the director of Fundaci\u00f3n MarViva Colombia, a regional conservation group. \u201c[San Bernardo] is now a completely different world to what I knew 40 years ago.\u201d\n\nThe fate of Maravilla Island serves as a stark reminder of the archipelago\u2019s predicament. Once known among locals as \u201cBird Island\u201d, because of its flocks of migrating frigates, albatrosses and pelicans, the one-hectare (2.47 acre) islet was granted state protection for \u201cits conditions to be preserved in perpetuity\u201d. Yet it had vanished by 2017, swallowed by rising seas. Now it is nothing more than a snorkelling spot for tourists.\n\nThere had been earlier warnings: the islands of Carivanita and P\u00e9rdida reportedly also disappeared about 60 years ago, according to a 2019 study.\n\nAnd Maravilla will not be the last in San Bernardo to vanish, according to local conservationists and scientists. \u201cThe long-term future for these islands is disappearance. It\u2019s a shame,\u201d says D\u00edaz.\n\nBoth Ceyc\u00e9n and Panda Islands teeter on the brink, with locals fearing they may be submerged within 10 years. Years ago, Panda Island was split in two as the rising seas penetrated and eroded its web of mangroves.\n\nM\u00facura Island is the largest in San Bernardo and is also battling the climate crisis. Flooding is commonplace, and one of the buildings most at risk is the primary school, which has about 30 pupils.\n\nFor years, anxious islanders have feared for the safety of the school. Its foundations have already collapsed once, and many fear it could happen again.\n\nCoastal erosion has also become a critical issue in San Bernardo. M\u00facura has the most extensive tourist infrastructure, with several hotels dotted along a coastline which has long been receding. Strong winds, rising tides and the indiscriminate felling of mangroves \u2013 vital to coastal protection \u2013 have accelerated the process.\n\nA 2014 local government report estimated that erosion has affected 45% of San Bernardo\u2019s coastlines. By 2040, 22% of M\u00facura will be flooded, according to the report. There has been no update in the nine years since the study.\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis has a very important impact on the economic issues of the small islands, as food fishing and the coral reefs will be deeply affected,\u201d says Sandra Vilardy, a prominent ecologist and, until recently, the Colombian vice-minister for the environment. \u201cIt impacts not only food security but also the physical security of the inhabitants.\u201d\n\nThe islands are disappearing in plain sight, and locals, as well as scientists and environmentalists, accuse the government of ignoring the problem. They fear it is now too late to salvage the situation.\n\nSan Bernardo is caught in an administrative gridlock. It is under the jurisdiction of the state\u2019s natural parks authority but is governed by the city of Cartagena, 48 miles away.\n\n\u201cNobody is taking action. I don\u2019t see any authority taking this issue seriously,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the park authority\u2019s interests for those people to be there [in San Bernardo] because it goes against their conservation objectives for the park. But it\u2019s also not their duty to invest in social matters either.\u201d\n\nVilardy says administrative inefficiency is trapping the islands, though she claims it is \u201cdifficult\u201d to make such cases a priority at state level. \u201cThe ministry of environment has no jurisdiction except to design policies.\n\n\u201cIn insular territories such as San Bernardo, the relevant authorities get a little more entangled because the actual jurisdiction lies on the mainland, so islands and archipelagos have a lot of difficulty being incorporated into public administration,\u201d she says.\n\nAttempts by local people to stave off the threat of climate crisis have run against the park authorities\u2019 environmental regulations, as they are said to interfere with the park\u2019s protected landscape. Yet many islanders say they have no choice, and build rudimentary shell walls to guard against the waves. Some have resorted to concrete walls.\n\nCaraballo, the environmental campaigner, is among those who have resorted to reforesting many of the degraded mangroves in hopes of helping the islands battle the rising tides and receding coastlines.\n\n\u201cWe have to mitigate the impact through the planting of mangroves. If we had some [state] support, we\u2019d see an improvement in the islands or some kind of recovery, but we just don\u2019t have that support,\u201d he says.\n\nAs the climate crisis rages on and the international community struggles to abide by its environmental commitments, Caraballo remains hopeful for a positive solution. Others have a bleaker outlook. \u201cIn the long term, there is nothing that can be done but run away,\u201d says D\u00edaz.\n\n\u201cWhat needs to be done is an evacuation plan. We still have time to do it progressively before tragedy strikes.\u201d", "screenshotUrl": null}]
