    "full_readme": "bestbuy-products-actor\nWhat does Best Buy Products Scraper do?\n\nOur free Best Buy product data scraper allows you to scrape product information from one of the most popular consumer electronics retailers: bestbuy.com\n\nBest Buy Products Scraper lets you extract data on:\n\nProduct categories\nProduct names\nURLs\nCurrent prices\nOriginal prices\nSales\nRatings\nAvailability\n\nYou can certainly use the official Best Buy API to download product information from Best Buy. But getting comprehensive data in machine-readable format is a little tricky, especially at scale, as there are limits to how much Best Buy product data you can get. Our Best Buy Products Scraper lets you overcome these limitations.\n\nHow much will it cost me to use?\n\nBest Buy Products Scraper consumes 1 compute unit per 1,000 results. That means you will pay approx. 25 cents for 1,000 results.\n\nNeed to find product pairs between BestBuy and another online shop?\n\nTry our AI Product Matcher. This AI model was created to compare items from different web stores, identifying exact matches and comparing real-time data obtained via web scraping. With the AI Product Matcher, you can scrape product data and then use it to monitor product matches across the industry, implement dynamic pricing for your website, replace or complement manual mapping, and obtain realistic estimates against your competition for upcoming promo campaigns.\n\nMost importantly, it is relatively easy to get started with (just follow this Product Matcher guide), and it can check 1,000 pairs of products for just $10.\n\nInput\n\nInsert the category URL from the 'Shop deals by category' section of the Best Buy website.\n\nChoose the maximum count of products to be scraped.\n\nSelect a proxy option from the proxy box (recommended).\n\nSelect the proxy country you want to us.\n\nClick Run and wait for the results to come in.\n\nExample\n\n{\"startUrls\":[{\"url\":\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/tv-deals\"}],\"proxy\":{\"useApifyProxy\":true},\"maxProducts\":0}\n\nOutput\n\nAfter the actor finishes its run, it will store the results in Dataset.\n\nGo to Dataset, and select the format you want from the export box.\n\nExample results\n{\n  \"name\": \"Samsung - Galaxy A52 5G 128GB (Unlocked) - Black\",\n  \"image\": \"https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6452/6452968_sd.jpg\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-128gb-unlocked-black/6452968.p?skuId=6452968\",\n  \"description\": \"Shop Samsung Galaxy A52 5G 128GB (Unlocked) Black at Best Buy.
