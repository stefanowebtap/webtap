First the USD 35 dollars per day charge, which was added to the room and to be used on food credits felt to be frank like price gouging. One felt helpless and undermined on having no say in the matter and would have a preferred a lower room rate by 35 dollars than being forced to spend the 35 dollars on unnecessary and unwanted food items\\n\\nThe second big issue which called for a lower rating was even just wanting two plain ordinary glasses, yes an ordinary glass was like pulling teeth. Multiple calls over 36 hours finally I was able to get my message across that NO, I DO NOT WANT YOUR PAPER GLASSES BUT A REAL GLASS\\n\\nFront office staff at the reception looks overworked and too caught up too patiently attend to a customer with a smile .\\n\\nThey can learn from the bellboys and conceirge team, who always had a smile and cheerfully went about doing their work. Must have interacted with atleast five of their team members and all of them had the same smiling, can do helpful attitude.\\n\\nRooms are large and simply fabulous with their magnificent views\\n\\nThe lobby is spacious , which is a rarity \\n\\nHence if you are just looking at a nice comfortable stay , then a stay at this property is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \\n\\n#newyorkhotels

Next, the Hotel rooms, spacious, well appointed and on floors 22 -44, so great views, particularly on the upper floors.  I was on floor 36 with a great view south, Empire state building right outside my window.  Staff, all great, respectful and were always glad to assist; great team.  I was recognized as a Diamond member; check. The only downside was the price of a full breakfast; 50 USD (plus tax).  that I find a bit pricey, but the only minus point.  I fully recommend staying here.\",\n    \"user\": {\n      \"userId\": \"EAAE6052D3334ACAF4DC5043FB1801E9\",\n      \"firstName\": null,\n      \"lastInitial\": null,\n      \"name\": null,\n      \"reviewerType\": null,\n      \"contributions\": {\n        \"reviews\": 100,\n        \"reviewCityCount\": 0,\n        \"restaurantReviews\": 35,\n        \"hotelReviews\": 35,\n        \"attractionReviews\": 30,\n        \"helpfulVotes\": 0,\n        \"photosCount\": 6,\n        \"badgesCount\": 0\n      },\n      \"memberId\": \"0\",\n      \"username\": \"L2210TBmarkc\",\n      \"userLocation\": {\n        \"name\": \"Belgium\",\n        \"id\": \"188634\"\n      },\n      \"avatar\": \"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg\",\n      \"link\": \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.EAAE6052D3334ACAF4DC5043FB1801E9\",\n      \"points\": 0,\n      \"createdTime\": \"2008-11-02T07:31:16-0500\",\n      \"locale\": \"en_US\"\n    },\n    \"ownerResponse\": {\n      \"id\": \"879469910\",\n      \"title\": \"Owner Response\",\n      \"text\": \"Mark C., we appreciate you taking the time to leave us with this great five star review.
