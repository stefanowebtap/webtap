    "full_readme": "\ud83d\udece\u00a0What does Booking Scraper do?\n\nThis web scraping tool allows you to extract data from Booking.com, one of the best-known platforms for hotels, apartments, resorts, villas, and other types of accommodation worldwide.\n\nBooking Scraper expands Booking data extraction beyond the official\u00a0Booking.com limitations. It allows you to scrape over 1,000 basic listings data at once from the Booking.com. To scrape only the basic details of each listing, use our dedicated Fast Booking Scraper \ud83c\udfce\ud83d\udca8\n\n\ud83e\uddf3\u00a0What data can I scrape from Booking?\n\nOur Booking Scraper is capable of extracting data such as:\n\n\ud83c\udfd6 Hotel names, descriptions and URLs\t\ud83d\udccd\u00a0Full address\n\u23f1 Check-in and check-out times\t\ud83d\udecf\u00a0Room availability and room specs\n\ud83d\udcb5 Room prices\t\ud83d\udec1 Features of each listing\n\u270d\ufe0f Total number of reviews\t\u2b50\ufe0f Rating and stars\n\ud83c\udf06 Image URLs\t\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddb0 Number of persons\n\ud83d\udcb8\u00a0How much will it cost to scrape Booking hotels?\n\nThis scraper uses the pay-per-result pricing model, so your costs can be easily calculated. It will cost you\u00a0$5 to scrape 1,000 search results, so 0.005 USD per item.\n\nApify\u2019s Free plan provides $5 free usage credits every month. For those credits, you can get up to\u00a01,000 results from Booking search results for free.\n\nIf you need to get more Booking listings regularly, you should grab an Apify subscription. We recommend our $49/month Starter plan - that one could get you up to 250,000 hotel results every month.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f\u00a0Input\n\nFor input, you can either specify a Destination \u2708\ufe0f\u00a0or use specific URLs from Booking.com website \ud83d\udd17 (you can apply all the necessary filters on the website beforehand).\n\nYou can then configure the scraper on which content you want to scrape (property type, minimum rating, price range, currency, language, etc.) You can also set the range of check-in and check-out dates and how many results you want.\n\nIf you want a step-by-step tutorial on how to scrape Booking, read our blog post on\u00a0how to scrape Booking.com\u00a0or watch this quick video tutorial:\n\nTips for scraping hotels on Booking\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0Booking.com website will only display a maximum of 1,000 results so that\u2019s how much the scraper can get at once. If you need more than that, you can use the Get more than 1000 results toggle. However, in that case, you won\u2019t be able to apply any limiting filters in URLs because the scraper will override them. Scraping by Destination will not be affected by the toggle.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 If you need to get detailed data about pricing or specific rooms, you need to provide checkIn and checkOut dates. The reason for this is that Booking.com only shows complete room and pricing info when dates are indicated.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0Sometimes Booking.com may return some suggested hotels outside of the expected city/region as a recommendation. The scraper will return all of them in the data results, so you may get more results than expected for your search.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f\u00a0Output example\n\nThe scraped Booking listings will be shown as a dataset which you can find in the Storage tab. Note that the output is organized as a table for viewing convenience:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can preview all the fields and choose in which format to download the data you\u2019ve extracted: JSON, Excel, HTML table, CSV, or XML.

It was built to extract review text, ratings, stars, basic reviewer info, length of stay, liked/disliked parts, room info, date of stay, and more for each listing.\n\n\u2753FAQ\nWhat are the disadvantages of the Booking API?\n\nThe Booking.com API interface is quite user-friendly, but getting that data in machine-processable format is no easy task. Booking.com places a lot of restrictions on how data can be collected from its listings, one of them being that Booking.com will display a\u00a0maximum of 1,000 results\u00a0for any given search. Our Booking Scraper doesn't impose any limitations on your results, so you can scrape data from Booking.com at scale.\n\nIs it legal to scrape listings on Booking.com?\n\nYes. However, you should note that personal data is protected by GDPR in the European Union and by other regulations around the world. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so. If you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. We also recommend that you read our blog post:\u00a0is web scraping legal?\n\nCan I integrate Booking Scraper with other apps?\n\nYes. Fast Booking Scraper can be connected with almost any cloud service or web app thanks to integrations on the Apify platform. You can integrate with Zapier, Slack, Make, LangChain, Airbyte, GitHub, Google Sheets, Google Drive,\u00a0and and with other Actors. Or you can use\u00a0webhooks\u00a0to carry out an action whenever an event occurs, e.g. get a notification whenever this scraper successfully finishes a run.\n\nCan I use Booking Scraper with API?\n\nYes. You can use Apify API to get programmatic access to the Apify platform. The API is organized around RESTful HTTP endpoints that enable you to manage, schedule, and run Apify actors. The API also lets you access any datasets, monitor Actor performance, fetch results, create and update versions, and more.\n\nTo access the API using Node.js, use the apify-client NPM package. To access the API using Python, use the apify-client PyPI package.\n\nCheck out the Apify API reference docs for full details or click on the API tab for code examples.
