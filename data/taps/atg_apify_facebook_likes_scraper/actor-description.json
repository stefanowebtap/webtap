However, you have to keep in mind that scraping facebook.com has many variables to it and may cause the results to fluctuate case by case. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all-use-cases number. The maximum number of results may vary depending on the complexity of the input, location, and other factors. Some of the most frequent cases are:\n\nwebsite gives a different number of results depending on the type/value of the input\nwebsite has an internal limit that no scraper can cross\nscraper has a limit that we are working on improving\n\nTherefore, while we regularly run Actor tests to keep the benchmarks in check, the results may also fluctuate without our knowing. The best way to know for sure for your particular use case is to do a test run yourself.\n\nHow much will scraping Facebook Likes cost you?\n\nWhen it comes to scraping, it can be challenging to estimate the resources needed to extract data as use cases may vary significantly. That's why the best course of action is to run a test scrape with a small sample of input data and limited output. You\u2019ll get your price per scrape, which you\u2019ll then multiply by the number of scrapes you intend to do.\n\nWatch this video for a few helpful tips. And don't forget that choosing a higher plan will save you money in the long run.\n\nWant to scrape Facebook Pages or comments?\n\nYou can use the dedicated scrapers below if you want to scrape specific Facebook data.
