    "full_readme": "Actor - edx Scraper\nedx scraper\n\nSince edx doesn't provide a proper free API, this actor should help you to retrieve data from it.\n\nThe edx data scraper supports the following features:\n\nScrape any courses you would like to get - You can search for a specific keyword and scrape the results accordingly.\n\nApply any of the filters - You can apply any filter provided by the website.\n\nScrape by language - You can filter by language from the actor default.\n\nLimit the results by page or amount of property. - If you don't want to get all the results but a specific amount you can limit it.\n\nBugs, fixes, updates, and changelog\n\nThis scraper is under active development. If you have any feature requests you can create an issue from here.\n\nInput Parameters\n\nThe input of this scraper should be JSON containing the list of pages on edx that should be visited. Possible fields are:\n\nsearch: (Optional) (String) Search keyword that you would like to search the courses in.\n\nlanguage: (Optional) (String) Scrape the results by the course language.\n\nmaxItems: (Optional) (Number) You can limit scraped items. This should be useful when you search through the big lists or search results.\n\nproxy: (Required) (Proxy Object) Proxy configuration.\n\nThis solution requires the use of Proxy servers, either your own proxy servers or you can use Apify Proxy.\n\nCompute Unit Consumption\n\nThe actor is optimized to run blazing fast and scrape many listings as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all listing detail requests. If the actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 listings in 1 minute with ~0.03-0.04 compute units.\n\nedx Scraper Input example\n{\n  \"search\":\"span\",\n  \"language\":\"English\",\n  \"maxItems\":10,\n  \"proxy\":{\n    \"useApifyProxy\":true\n  }\n}\n\nDuring the Run\n\nDuring the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified. When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.\n\nIf you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.\n\nedx Export\n\nDuring the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.\n\nYou can manage the results in any language (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or our API reference to learn more about getting results from this edx actor.\n\nScraped edx Properties\n\nThe structure of each item in edx listings looks like this:\n\n###Course Output\n\n{\n    \"uuid\": \"09222e6c-a1bc-4307-ba80-294ea4281117\",\n    \"title\": \"Shaping Work of the Future\",\n    \"inProspectus\": true,\n    \"prospectusPath\": \"/course/shaping-work-of-the-future\",\n    \"organizationShortCodeOverride\": \"\",\n    \"organizationLogoOverrideUrl\": null,\n    \"courseType\": \"verified-audit\",\n    \"inYearValue\": null,\n    \"activeCourseRun\": {\n        \"key\": \"course-v1:MITx+15.662x+1T2020\",\n        \"type\": \"verified\",\n        \"marketingUrl\": \"https://www.edx.org/course/shaping-work-of-the-future-3\",\n        \"minEffort\": 4,\n        \"maxEffort\": 5,\n        \"weeksToComplete\": 8\n    },\n    \"image\": {\n        \"src\": \"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/09222e6c-a1bc-4307-ba80-294ea4281117-e28e19d05647.small.jpg\"\n    },\n    \"locationRestriction\": null,\n    \"owners\": [\n        {\n            \"key\": \"MITx\",\n            \"logoImageUrl\": \"https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/organization/logos/2a73d2ce-c34a-4e08-8223-83bca9d2f01d-2cc8854c6fee.png\",\n            \"name\": \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"recentEnrollmentCount\": 1149,\n    \"topics\": [],\n    \"additionalMetadata\": null,\n    \"objectID\": \"course-09222e6c-a1bc-4307-ba80-294ea4281117\",\n    \"cardType\": \"course\",\n    \"cardIndex\": 3,\n    \"url\": \"https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+15.662x+1T2020/home.\"\n}\nContact\n\nPlease visit us through epctex.com to see all the products that are available for you.
