Therefore, it forefronts all product detail requests. If actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape ~250 products in 3 minutes with 0.0235 compute units.\n\nDuring the Run\n\nDuring the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified. When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.\n\nIf you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.\n\nGutenberg Export\n\nDuring the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.\n\nYou can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM).
