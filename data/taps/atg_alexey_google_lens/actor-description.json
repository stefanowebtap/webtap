    "full_readme": "This Actor is an unofficial Google Lens API capable to identify text on images, recognize objects on images even without text, and search by images. Provided with an image URL, this Google Lens API will extract the image type, an array of OCR text fragments, locale, and optional site links for visual matches.\n\nWhat is a Google Lens Actor and what does it do?\n\nIt does pretty much the same thing as Google Lens itself except it also provides you with programmatic access to the results, namely the results of:\n\n\ud83d\udd0d\u00a0OCR, text and alt text recognition, and translation\n\n\ud83c\udf81\u00a0Object recognition and classification\n\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u00a0Reverse image search\n\n\ud83d\udcda\u00a0Converting images into text\n\n\ud83d\udcbd\u00a0Double use as Google Lens API\n\nHow do I get OCR data from Google Lens?\nCreate\u00a0a free Apify account using your email.\nOpen\u00a0Google Lens Actor.\nFind an image link.\nFeed the image link to the Actor.\nClick \"Start\" and wait for the data to be extracted and matched.\nDownload your Google Lens data in JSON, XML, CSV, Excel, or HTML.\n\nIf you need guidance on how to run the scraper, you can follow our\u00a0step-by-step tutorial\u00a0\ud83d\udd17\n\nHow can I use Google Lens Actor?\n\n\ud83e\uddbe\u00a0Bootstrap AI training with image datasets\n\n\ud83e\ude9e\u00a0Find similar products and visuals\n\n\u2728\u00a0Support creative work such as graphic or web design\n\n\ud83d\udd26\u00a0Detect specific content across the web\n\nInput example\n\nThe input for Google Lens API should be an image URL you need OCR data from. The image can be from anywhere on the web: blog, newspaper, e-shop, social media posts such as Instagram or Twitter, etc. You can add one or multiple image URLs with an image format at the end such as .png or .jpg. See the input tab for a full explanation of input in JSON.\n\n{\n    \"startUrls\": [\n        { \"url\": \"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/two-glasses-of-wine-and-summer-fruits-on-the-beach-royalty-free-image-1635272439.jpg\" },\n        { \"url\": \"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDXLWcWMSy7iTEEmJZmwDG7mzCXNjB0NJ-M33XyIPmEHu7EAN7NTQF6wrxI5O895zmRo9KReAAi2eoeQFE_W6WqmCc-IeKa9L2wCJ9fyijXwLlYzNQAv3BMRK0yQmqQbG_g3wbg1tTcsWO-AGH6TRtcA1ZXYT102FGAngVS9KHNXBvcYuUT6I77cYt/s4032/SeoulProSoyFront.JPG\" }\n    ],\n    \"addMatchedImageSources\": true\n}\nOutput example\n\nThe results will be wrapped into a dataset which you can find in the Storage tab. You can choose in which format to download your Google Lens data: JSON, JSONL, Excel spreadsheet, HTML table, CSV, or XML.\n\nImages containing text\n\nIf the image has text on it, you can easily get all the OCR data. Moreover, if your image includes a product type known to Google Lens, you will get a short\u00a0imageType description:\n\n[{\n  \"url\": \"https://www.maisonmargiela-fragrances.eu/dw/image/v2/BDCR_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-margiela-master-catalog/default/dw3fbc4479/images/products/MM003/MM003_002.jpg?sw=750&sh=750&sm=cut&sfrm=jpg&q=70\",\n  \"imageType\": \"MAISON MARGIELA Replica Eau De Toilette Spray\",\n  \"ocrTextLocale\": \"en\",\n  \"ocrText\": [\n    \"Musc\",\n    \"REPLICA\",\n    \"REPRODUCTION OF FAMILIAR SCENTS AND MOMENTS OF VARYING LOCATIONS AND PERIODS\",\n    \"Originally:\",\n    \"Beach Walk\",\n    \"Calvi 1972\",\n    \"Provenance and Period:Fragrance Description:Style Description:\",\n    \"Sun kissed salty skin\",\n    \"Female fragrance\",\n    \"Maison Margiela PARIS\",\n    \"Bergamot\",\n    \"Coconut Milk\",\n    \"Ylang Ylang\"\n  ],\n  \"matchesCount\": 42\n}]\nImages containing no text\n\nIn case there is no text on the image to be scanned and referred to, you might still get an imageType in description if it is known to Google Lens.\n\n{\n\t\"url\": \"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/index1-1605618242.jpg\",\n\t\"imageType\": \"Pierce Brosnan\",\n\t\"matchesCount\": 60\n}\n\nImage matches found\n\nSometimes the imageType cannot be identified. In that case, you can also search for visual matches without spending extra CUs. However, please note that the resulting matches wouldn't be direct image links but thumbnails, a.k.a static images generated by Google. You can use the matched images as a reference or as a wide guess for cases when the image can not be recognized as specific type.\n\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://blog.apify.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-17.01.39-1.png\",\n  \"imageType\": \"Unknown Type\",\n  \"matchesCount\": 60,\n  \"matches\": [\n    {\n      \"thumb\": \"https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTLT_m1JfUJQp4UY_HfbAFOMJleG7gxh88GHoDZuQgjhBo858gD\",\n      \"websiteTitle\": \"Coming soon: National Opportunity Zones Marketplace - Smart Growth America\",\n      \"websiteUrl\": \"https://smartgrowthamerica.org/coming-soon-national-opportunity-zones-marketplace/\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"thumb\": \"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQinUS15ZYiWRAv8E46mcoYelLBej6nkyA9hVwikCqJzoim0KKp\",\n      \"websiteTitle\": \"Zones (green) and corridors (red lines) of clusters of inner city... | Download Scientific Diagram\",\n      \"websiteUrl\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Zones-green-and-corridors-red-lines-of-clusters-of-inner-city-biophilic-elements-in_fig2_337842964\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"thumb\": \"https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSsoteufMUU8fSATFX6TuInnLbUlD_FlocAmUMe1F915z6gyTsm\",\n      \"websiteTitle\": \"Climate Change and The Greenway - The Rose Kennedy Greenway\",\n      \"websiteUrl\": \"https://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/climate-change-and-the-greenway/\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"thumb\": \"https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQsxZhcKPyZLqJbrRuGkt23zHm_naRzeXPJlgYbwyWa2SoZ9EnN\",\n      \"websiteTitle\": \"Archive: Governor Andrew Cuomo on Twitter: \\\"We have a clear and effective plan to respond to any clusters that threaten our progress.
