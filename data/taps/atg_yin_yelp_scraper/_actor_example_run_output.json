Even for lunch time, I suggest you try to get a reservation since this place is incredibly busy for a weekday lunch and all tables were full. We were seated promptly in the very back section of the restaurant (which I did not even know existed?) that is tucked away and a little bit more quiet than the entrance, which I appreciated. Service this time left me a little bit unimpressed which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. Our server felt a little dry and curt, less patient that prior times I've been here, and also forgot one of the items we ordered. Not sure if it's because we were in the very back but it made us feel like the service was less attentive than before. We split a few items on the menu which were delicious and made the trip worth it: \n\nTie-Dye Pizza: now I understand why this is one of their most popular items. Even though I'm a pretty traditional gal with pizza, this pie was dreamy. First of all, the aesthetics are unmatched: the pizza is vibrantly colored at its base and then gets a perfect swirl of pesto right in front of you at the table. It also has an insanely thin crust that just looked perfectly crispy and elegant. The flavors were also really balanced. I loved the combination of having both tomato and vodka sauce since there was a nice sweet and tangy/more acidic contrast that was very nicely tied together by the creamy and salty mozzarella. The pesto was super subtle and was the perfect complement without being overpowering. The crust was sooo crispy and the slices were so thin! It was delicious... I will definitely be ordering this whenever I come back in the future. \n\nLumanche Alla Vodka: my stepdad loves vodka pasta so we had to order this dish. Both my parents were blown away by this dish and really loved the sauce. I personally thought it was good but not any better than at other places in Little Italy. The pasta was not as Al dente as I would have liked and I felt like the sauce lacked some punch. However my family was very happy which is what mattered to me more since this is the dish they were most excited to have. They both said they liked this better than the pizza (possible pasta bias here). \n\nTiramisu: their desserts have never disappointed and this was the best one I've tried on their menu so far! The slice of tiramisu is generous, the mascarpone blend is mildly sweet but not overpowering, perfectly creamy, and it's sandwiched between perfectly moist lady fingers that were not soggy at all. The flavor of the coffee was perfect! Loved this dessert and would order again in a heartbeat.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience here! The food was still fantastic and if you are able to get a reservation the week before, I think it's well worth it. Prices are steeper than other places you can find in the city but the ingredients they use are very high quality and the ambiance is very nice-- it's also just a NYC classic that everyone should try at least once. Service was a little disappointing this time around but I've had good experiences before so it could have been just a random blip. I will definitely be coming back in the future for more delicious pizza!", "language": "en", "isFunnyCount": 0, "isUsefulCount": 1, "isCoolCount": 1, "photoUrls": ["https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SE_QGEdnHWlAla7K4S-Exg/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-wPK-TqQpCahNqU4dgZTHA/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aJ8Qm7DiE1tbkWii6NSf5w/o.jpg", "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gKIKgMuEZDhkuCLSoCtE_Q/o.jpg"], "reviewerName": null, "reviewerUrl": null, "reviewerReviewCount": 189, "reviewerLocation": "New York, NY", "id": "JBaA9_xmGWsARoagVHQa8g"}, {"date": "2023-10-17T00:00:00.000Z", "rating": 5, "text": "We did not have a reservation but wanted to check Rubirosa out because we had heard great things.

It was very dark so hard to take pictures without either the flash or them turning up blurry. For pizza you can do split halves, so one side we did the tie dye which has a pesto drizzle.

There's just a table or two with a few seats, otherwise, you can grab a stool or stand at one of countertops along the walls. Looking at the fully covered walls, I was pleasantly reminded that this place has made many a cameo in films and TV - such as Toby Maguire's Spiderman, Sex and the City, and Along Came Polly. Also, many celebrities and renown figures have also left their mark of approval here. I think my eyes were sparkling with childlike giddiness as I scanned through the glass displays. I let them know which pizzas and number of slices I wanted before heading to the register to pay. From the busy back and forth of the workers behind the counter to the nonstop chatter of orders being placed, the bustling sights and sounds of life tightly hugs you. \n\nEach slice is colossal! It's like a blanket of tantalizing yumminess that requires a two-hand hold. A pizza slice costs around $5, and it's well worth every penny! It's hard to precisely put down the flavor experience I had upon first bite, but I will say I fell immediately in love the moment I chomped down. There is something special about the thin pizza crust - a beautiful wisp of smokiness from the slightly charred spots, an almost tangy tinge like sourdough, and the perfect marriage of crunch and chewiness in terms of texture.\n\nMy two slices were spinach & cheese and the \"supreme\" style pizza (pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, onions).

For $4-5, it's a good deal and sizeable slice. The crust was crisp, but I was hoping for more flavorful in the ingredients.

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and only waited about 15 minutes. \n\nThe Meatball & Ricotta Red Pie is the shit. Generous amount of meatballs and giant globs of creamy ricotta served piping hot. God, it was so freakin' good. Pair it with a beer - it's the ultimate combo. \n\nThe Bruschetta served on Rustic Bread was made with vine ripe tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, oil, onion, grated cheese with salts and peppers. One order comes with four pieces. I found it to be wonderful. It was fresh and the seasonings were plentiful. As with the pizza, each slice was generously prepared.\n\nThe prices are a little bit on the steeper end. But when you're America's First Pizzeria (?), you get to charge whatever you want. \n\nCash only.
