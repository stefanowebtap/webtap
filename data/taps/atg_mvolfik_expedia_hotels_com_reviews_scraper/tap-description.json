        "debugLog is an optional field. It enables more verbose logging",
        "maxRequestRetries is an optional field. It determines the maximum number of retries when a request fails",
        "sortBy is an optional field. It does not affect the order of reviews in the dataset, since review items are scraped in parallel, so later pages might finish before previous ones. However, it helps in the case you are limited by the number of reviews you can scrape",
