        "The domains must be naked, i.e. specified without a protocol and sub-domains (e.g. example.com).",
        "If you have a large list of domains, use 'domainsFileUrl' to provide a URL of a text file that contains the list of domains to crawl.",
        "Use 'domainsFileOffset' to indicate how many domains from the file should be skipped in the beginning. This is useful if you only want to crawl a portion of the domains.",
        "Use 'domainsFileCount' to indicate how many domains from the file should be crawled, starting from the offset. Leave empty to crawl all domains.",
        "If 'useChrome' is checked, the tool uses Chrome instead of Puppeteer's Chromium for the crawling. This might help to prevent blocking of some pages.",
        "'maxRequestRetries' indicates how many times shall the crawler retry to load a page on error.",
        "'crawlLinkCount' indicates how many links from the main page going to the same domain shall also be crawled.",
        "If 'crawlHttpsVersion' is checked, the tool attempts to crawl HTTPs version of the website (e.g. https://example.com for domain example.com).",
        "If 'crawlWwwSubdomain' is checked, the tool attempts to crawl www. sub-domain of the website (e.g. http://www.example.com for domain example.com).",
        "If 'saveScreenshot' is checked, the tool stores screenshots of all loaded pages into the key-value store.",
        "If 'saveHtml' is checked, the tool stores HTML content of all loaded pages into the key-value store.",
        "If 'saveText' is checked, the tool stores text content of all loaded pages into the dataset results.",
        "If 'considerChildFrames' is checked, the tool searches for social handles even in the content of the first-level child frames. The 'page.text' also contains the combined text of the main frame and direct child frames.",
        "The tool will return all the fields listed in OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS regardless of any policy, legal, privacy or any other limit",
        "Always set proxyConfiguration : {{  \"useApifyProxy\": true    }}"
