Whilst the Internet is renowned for being a worldwide network free from central coordination, there is a technical need for some key parts of the Internet to be globally coordinated, and this coordination role is undertaken by us.\nSpecifically, we allocate and maintain unique codes and numbering systems that are used in the technical standards (\u201cprotocols\u201d) that drive the Internet.\nOur various activities can be broadly grouped in to three categories:\nDomain Names\nManagement of the DNS Root, the .int and .arpa domains, and an IDN practices resource.\nNumber Resources\nCo-ordination of the global pool of IP and AS numbers, primarily providing them to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).\nProtocol Assignments\nInternet protocols\u2019 numbering systems are managed in conjunction with standards bodies.\nWe are one of the Internet's oldest institutions, with the IANA functions dating back to the 1970s. Today the services are provided by Public Technical Identifiers, a purpose-built organization for providing the IANA functions to the community. PTI is an affiliate of ICANN, an internationally-organised non-profit organisation set up by the Internet community to coordinate our areas of responsibilities.\nMission Statement\nThis statement describes the role of PTI:\nPTI is responsible for the operational aspects of coordinating the Internet\u2019s unique identifiers and maintaining the trust of the community to provide these services in an unbiased, responsible and effective manner.\nOur Policy Remit\nWe do not directly set policy by which we operate, instead we implement agreed policies and principles in a neutral and responsible manner. Using the policy-setting forums provided by ICANN, policy development for domain name operations and IP addressing is arrived at by many different stakeholders. ICANN has a structure of supporting organisations that contribute to deciding how ICANN runs, which in turn informs how PTI is operated. The development of Internet protocols, which often dictate how protocol assignments should be managed, are arrived at within the Internet Engineering Task Force, the Internet Engineering Steering Group, and the Internet Architecture Board.\nTo improve its operations, we are actively involved in outreach too. As well as in ICANN forums, we participate in meetings and discussions with TLD operators, Regional Internet Registries, and other relevant communities. We provide manned helpdesks at key meetings to allow one-to-one interaction with our community of users, such as protocol developers and operators of critical Internet infrastructure.\nAbout us\nIntroduction\nPerformance Reporting\nProcedures\nPresentations\nPublic Reports\nFramework Documents\nReviews\nAudits\nExcellence & Quality\nContact us\nDomain Names\t\nRoot Zone Registry\n.INT Registry\n.ARPA Registry\nIDN Repository\n\t\nNumber Resources\t\nAbuse Information\n\t\nProtocols\t\nProtocol Registries\nTime Zone Database\n\t\nAbout Us\t\nPerformance\nReports\nReviews\nExcellence\nContact Us\n\t\nThe IANA functions coordinate the Internet\u2019s globally unique identifiers, and are provided by Public Technical Identifiers, an affiliate of ICANN.\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service"}, {"domain": "iana.org", "url": "https://www.iana.org/about/excellence", "response": {"url": "https://www.iana.org/about/excellence", "status": 200, "remoteAddress": {"ip": "192.0.46.8", "port": 443}, "headers": {"cache-control": "public, max-age=3600", "connection": "Keep-Alive", "content-encoding": "br", "content-length": "1532", "content-security-policy": "upgrade-insecure-requests; default-src 'self' https://*.iana.org; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.google.com https://cse.google.com https://clients1.google.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.google.com; child-src 'self' https://www.youtube.com https://clients1.google.com https://cse.google.com https://www.google.com/; img-src 'self' https://data.iana.org https://www.iana.org https://www.google.com https://www.googleapis.com https://clients1.google.com https://*.gstatic.com;", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "date": "Mon, 06 Nov 2023 16:41:05 GMT", "expires": "Mon, 06 Nov 2023 17:41:05 GMT", "keep-alive": "timeout=2, max=353", "last-modified": "Sun, 18 Jul 2021 22:53:48 GMT", "referrer-policy": "same-origin", "server": "Apache", "strict-transport-security": "max-age=48211200; preload", "vary": "Accept-Encoding", "x-content-type-options": "nosniff\nnosniff", "x-frame-options": "DENY"}, "securityDetails": {"issuer": "DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1", "protocol": "TLS 1.3", "subjectName": "*.iana.org", "validFrom": "2022-12-12T00:00:00.000Z", "validTo": "2024-01-12T23:59:59.000Z"}}, "page": {"title": "Business Excellence and Quality Management", "linkUrls": ["http://pti.icann.org", "http://www.efqm.org/efqm-model/model-criteria", "http://www.efqm.org/what-we-do/recognition/committed-to-excellence", "http://www.icann.org", "https://www.iana.org", "https://www.iana.org/about", "https://www.iana.org/about/audits", "https://www.iana.org/about/excellence", "https://www.iana.org/about/framework", "https://www.iana.org/about/presentations", "https://www.iana.org/abuse", "https://www.iana.org/contact", "https://www.iana.org/domains", "https://www.iana.org/domains/arpa", "https://www.iana.org/domains/idn-tables", "https://www.iana.org/domains/int", "https://www.iana.org/domains/root", "https://www.iana.org/numbers", "https://www.iana.org/performance", "https://www.iana.org/procedures", "https://www.iana.org/protocols", "https://www.iana.org/reports", "https://www.iana.org/reviews", "https://www.iana.org/time-zones", "https://www.icann.org/privacy/policy", "https://www.icann.org/privacy/tos"], "linkedDataObjects": []}, "social": {"emails": [], "phones": [], "phonesUncertain": [], "linkedIns": [], "twitters": [], "instagrams": [], "facebooks": [], "youtubes": []}, "screenshot": {"url": "https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/AZ7tKBJUMSbw3tDf5/records/screenshot-iana.org-06.jpg", "length": 98790}, "html": {"url": "https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/AZ7tKBJUMSbw3tDf5/records/content-iana.org-06.html", "length": 6870}, "text": "Domains\nProtocols\nNumbers\nAbout\nBusiness Excellence and Quality Management\nWe are committed to operations excellence and have had an ongoing Business Excellence activity for the IANA functions since 2009.

Most of the used numbers are allocated via a regional allocation system to your ISP, which then automatically assigns one or more to you.\nThere are, however, special sets of numbers that are designed not to be assigned to any particular person. Instead, they are general allocations that are either used in special ways, or designed for people to use internally within local networks. \nThese numbers are primarily in the following ranges:\nBegins with 10. (i.e. 10.0.0.0 through to 10.255.255.255)\nBegins with 127.\nBegins with 169.254.\nBegins with 172.16. through 172.31.\nBegins with 192.168.\nShows up in your logs with a name like blackhole-1.iana.org\nThere are additional ranges of numbers that are also marked as \u201cIANA Reserved\u201d and similarly are not operated by IANA, although these are the most common ones we receive abuse reports concerning.\nIf you are seeing unexplained Internet traffic to your computer from these numbers, it is important to remember the following things:\nThe traffic does not come from IANA. As the authority for IP addresses, we have simply reserved these numbers in our databases, but we do not use or operate them, and we are not the source of the traffic.\n\nAs use of these numbers is untracked and unrestricted, we can not tell you who is using these numbers.\n\nIt is perfectly normal to see traffic from these numbers if you have a small home or office network. By default, most routers and access points use these numbers to assign to your local computers. It is most likely these numbers represent computers on your own internal network.\n\nIf you see these numbers in the headers of an unsolicited email, they usually indicate transit between servers within a corporate network or ISP.

Part of our tasks includes evaluating requests to change the operators of country code domains, as well as day-to-day maintenance of the details of the existing operators.\n.INT\nThe .int top-level domain, designed for the sole use of cross-national organisations, such as treaty organisations, that do not naturally fit into a specific country\u2019s top-level domain. For example, who.int for the World Health Organisation.\n.ARPA\nThe .arpa domain is used internally by Internet protocols, such as for reverse mapping of IP addresses, and delivery of ENUM phone number mapping. We administer this domain in close liaison with the Internet Architecture Board, which has policy responsibility for .arpa.\nIDN Practices Repository\nTo help foster the deployment of Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs), a repository of \u201cIDN tables\u201d which document the permissable characters for different languages and scripts provided for registration by different top-level domain registries. The repository is informative, and designed for information sharing.\nRoot Key Signing Key\nThe Root Key Signing Key provides verification of the DNSSEC-signed root zone.\nSpecial Purpose Domains\nA number of special domains are reserved or managed for demonstration purposes, or for future use.\nDomain Names\nOverview\nRoot Zone Management\nOverview\nRoot Database\nHint and Zone Files\nChange Requests\nInstructions & Guides\nRoot Servers\n.INT Registry\nOverview\nRegister/modify an .INT domain\nEligibility\n.ARPA Registry\nIDN Practices Repository\nOverview\nSubmit a table\nRoot Key Signing Key (DNSSEC)\nOverview\nTrusts Anchors and Keys\nKey Signing Ceremonies\nPolicies & Procedures\nCommunity Representatives\nProject Archive\nReserved Domains\nDomain Names\t\nRoot Zone Registry\n.INT Registry\n.ARPA Registry\nIDN Repository\n\t\nNumber Resources\t\nAbuse Information\n\t\nProtocols\t\nProtocol Registries\nTime Zone Database\n\t\nAbout Us\t\nPerformance\nReports\nReviews\nExcellence\nContact Us\n\t\nThe IANA functions coordinate the Internet\u2019s globally unique identifiers, and are provided by Public Technical Identifiers, an affiliate of ICANN.\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service"}]
