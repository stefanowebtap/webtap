        "The Notification emails option allows you to receive notifications whenever the tool discovers broken links. You can add multiple email addresses.",
        "The Save only broken links option, if set to false, will save all checked links and all information about them. This is not CSV friendly.",
        "The Crawl subdomains option, if set to true, will allow the tool to crawl all links recursively.",
        "The Max concurrency option allows you to limit the number of pages from the target website to crawl in parallel. This can be used to reduce the load on the target web server.",
