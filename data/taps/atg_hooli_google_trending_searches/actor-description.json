    "full_readme": "What is Google Trending Searches Scraper?\n\nThis scraper is designed to extract data from Daily Search Trends in the Trending Searches section on Google Trends. It creates a Google Trending Searches API that is not constrained by the quotas or limits imposed by Google Trends.\n\nFeatures\n\nWhy use our Google Trending Searches API to extract information from Google Trends?\n\nThe data you get from this scraper is flat and not nested in JSON format.\nThe data it outputs is designed to be CSV friendly, so you can immediately use it in spreadsheets, applications, reports, or other Apify actors.\nYou can select your own time frame by setting \"to\" and \"from\" dates\".\nYou can freely select the region or regions to be scraped.\nYou can easily use our scheduler to scrape data when you need it.\nOur scraper is not limited by the unpredictable quotas or limits imposed by Google Trends.\n\nNote that Google Trending Searches can only provide data going back 29 days, so our API cannot overcome this limitation.\n\nIf you use Google Trending Searches Scraper with our Google Trends Scraper, you can get a lot of useful data from Google Trends and use it for market research or search engine optimization. If you need inspiration, check out some of the use cases suggested on our Marketing & Media industries page or read our blog post about using Apify Store to power your SEO toolbox.\n\nYou can also combine this actor with tools such as our Google Sheets Import & Export to automatically feed the data into Google Sheets.\n\nThe data extracted can be downloaded in a range of formats, including JSON, CSV, XML, HTML, and Excel.\n\nCost of usage\n\nRunning the Google Trending Searches Scraper will consume platform credits. Every Apify subscription plan includes a set monthly USD amount of platform credits. If you require more, you will have to upgrade your plan. Check our platform pricing and subscription plan pages for details.\n\nYou can expect to spend less than $0.10 for 1,000 results, so your monthly free platform credits should be enough for many actor runs. The best way to find out how many platform credits an actor will consume is to perform a test run. You can then review platform usage in Billing and figure out the best Apify subscription plan for your needs.\n\nIf you want something special or require end-to-end service, you can also request a custom solution.\n\nTutorial\n\nCheck out our step-by-step guide to using the Google Trending Searches Scraper or email us at support@apify.com if you need any help.\n\nYou can also join the conversation on our Discord server, where the Apify team and community regularly discuss web scraping tips and tricks.\n\nInput and Output\n\nThis actor has been developed to take advantage of the new extended output functionality of the Apify platform.
