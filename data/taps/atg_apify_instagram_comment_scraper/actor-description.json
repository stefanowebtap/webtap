    "full_readme": "What is Instagram Comment Scraper?\n\nInstagram Comment Scraper allows you to extract comments from one or more Instagram post URLs.\n\nHow many results can you scrape with Instagram Comments scraper?\n\nNote that the actor returns a maximum of 50 comments per post. It only extracts comments shown to Instagram users who are not logged in. That means the results may differ from what you see when logged in to your Instagram account. To try it out, open an incognito window on your browser and copy the post URL. The comments you\u2019ll see there are the comments that this actor will save in a dataset. You have to keep in mind that scraping Instagram is dynamic and subject to change. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all-use-cases number. The maximum number of results may vary depending on the complexity of the input, location, and other factors.\n\nTherefore, while we regularly run Actor tests to keep the benchmarks in check, the results may also fluctuate without our knowing. The best way to know for sure for your particular use case is to do a test run yourself.\n\nWhy scrape Instagram comments?\n\nScraping comments on Instagram posts can give you quick insights into how an audience is reacting to marketing campaigns and enable you to spot misinformation or abuse, track audience engagement, or help you monitor how competing content is being received.\n\nIf you want more ideas, check out our industries pages for ways web scraping is already being used in a wide range of companies.\n\nHow to scrape Instagram comments and likes\n\nInstagram Comment Scraper is designed to be fast and easy to use so there aren't too many parameters or settings. Just follow the steps below:\n\nCreate a free Apify account.\nOpen Instagram Comment Scraper\nAdd one or more Instagram post URLs to scrape.\nClick Start and wait for the datasets to be extracted.\nDownload your data in JSON, XML, CSV, Excel, or HTML.\nInstagram Comment Scraper tutorial\n\nIf you want more guidance on how to use Instagram Comment Scraper, this video tutorial shows you how to do it in just a few minutes\n\nHow much will scraping Instagram comments cost you?\n\nWhen it comes to scraping, it can be challenging to estimate the resources needed to extract data as use cases may vary significantly. That's why the best course of action is to run a test scrape with a small sample of input data and limited output. You\u2019ll get your price per scrape, which you\u2019ll then multiply by the number of scrapes you intend to do.\n\nWatch this video for a few helpful tips. And don't forget that choosing a higher plan will save you money in the long run.\n\nIs it legal to scrape Instagram comments?\n\nOur Instagram scrapers are ethical and do not extract any private user data, such as email addresses, gender, or location. They only extract what the user has chosen to share publicly. We therefore believe that our scrapers, when used for ethical purposes by Apify users, are safe. However, you should be aware that your results could contain personal data. Personal data is protected by the GDPR in the European Union and by other regulations around the world. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so. If you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. You can also read our blog posts on the legality of web scraping and ethical scraping.\n\nIntegrations and Instagram Comment Scraper\n\nInstagram Comment Scraper can be connected with almost any cloud service or web app thanks to integrations on the Apify platform.

The actor can be integrated with various cloud services and web apps, and it can be used with the Apify API for programmatic access. The input example shows the required JSON format, and the output example demonstrates the structure of the scraped comments. If you need to scrape other Instagram data, there are dedicated scrapers available. If the provided scraper doesn't meet your requirements, you can build your own using Apify's scraper templates or request a custom scraping solution."
