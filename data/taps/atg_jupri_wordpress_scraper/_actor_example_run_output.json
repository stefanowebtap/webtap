This contributed to fostering an inclusive environment for each individual while providing a space for everyone to learn about different cultures and cultural affinities and have the opportunity to highlight who they are\u2014authentically without judgment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur Diversity and Inclusion committee planned this day to highlight \u2018belonging\u2019 as a focal point of this year\u2019s celebration,\u201d said Chenayi Mukaro, Head of People Experience. \u201cIt was important to the committee to emphasize being your authentic self and encouraging everyone to take time to understand each other and their backgrounds.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a show of celebration and participation on this special day, employees came dressed in their cultural attire that represented their ethnic backgrounds or their chosen cultural association. From delicate African cuisines that symbolized the culinary journey of foods from various cultures and scenes to personal speeches prepared by employees to express what \u2018Heritage Day\u2019 means to them, this bridged a connection and helped showcase how diversity plays a greater role in creativity at Sony Music Entertainment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[This] event allowed an opportunity for us to meet each other at a point of realness. I did not know that a simple event and cultural clothing would bond us as a Sony Music family. I am aware of who I am culturally, I am an African with a South African culture. I felt respected and honored,\u201d said Caroline Morabe, Label Manager. \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy how we appreciate each of our diverse cultures. Africa is amazing and we are here to make sure that the Sony vision is realized.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read an employee speech in celebration of \u2018Heritage Day\u2019 from Digital Services and Partner Manager, Blessing Manafa, from Sony Music Nigeria below:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have you ever noticed that the same of two things never make a new thing?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have you ever noticed that new experiences don\u2019t ever really come by doing the same routine?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have you ever wondered why it takes a mix of red and blue &#8211; two completely different colors to make purple?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Imagine a world where only reds existed &#8211; this means the beauty of purple could never have been born nor experienced.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thankfully, we do not live in such a world. Our world is full of reds, blue\u2014all unconsciously tasked to, with interacting in various capacities, to birth \u201cpurple.\u201d</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By \u201cpurple\u201d I mean new experiences, fresh perspectives, alternate angles to the same picture.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To speak plainly, everyone here symbolizes a red or a blue and it is our responsibility to create purple ourselves fully realizing that without the rich, bright, and unstoppable red or the wonderful, calm, and powerful blue &#8211; we can never have purple.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This means all that makes us who we are, all that has contributed to where we are from indeed has a place here.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Meaning \u201chere\u201d ought to be a place where our unique stories and backgrounds &#8211; our heritage &#8211; do not take a back seat. Instead that very heritage becomes the catalyst that creates the purple in our relationships within and outside our work environment.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Being a Nigerian born from two major tribes &#8211; Igbo &amp; Yoruba, I can tell you that I have come to appreciate and value firsthand the beauty of diversity, and this has led me to the conclusion that we are indeed all pieces of the same whole.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A whole that can never be seen and fully appreciated without its individual parts.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Happy Heritage Day &#8211; keep creating wonderful purple experiences!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.smehost.net/2019sonymusiccom-smeprod/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QR-code-Sony-Africa-150x150.png\" alt=\"A Sense of Belonging on Heritage Day: Embracing Diverse Cultures at Sony Music\u00a0\" class=\"wp-image-12996\" style=\"width:112px;height:112px\" width=\"112\" height=\"112\" srcset=\"https://cdn.smehost.net/2019sonymusiccom-smeprod/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QR-code-Sony-Africa-150x150.png 150w, https://cdn.smehost.net/2019sonymusiccom-smeprod/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QR-code-Sony-Africa-300x300.png 300w, https://cdn.smehost.net/2019sonymusiccom-smeprod/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QR-code-Sony-Africa-110x110.png 110w, https://cdn.smehost.net/2019sonymusiccom-smeprod/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QR-code-Sony-Africa.png 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" /></figure></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<p>Scan here to listen to <strong>Certified Heritage</strong>, the event&#8217;s official playlist consisting entirely of artists from Sony Music South Africa.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Certified Heritage playlist artwork was created by <strong>Maria Hadjidimitriadis</strong>, Strategic Catalogue Marketing Manager, Sony Music Entertainment Africa. \u201cThis artwork was inspired by our rich cultural diversity and passion for our music,\u201d says Maria. \u201cThe cover artwork is depicted as a quilt which is pieced together using traditional prints, each representing a different ethnicity across Sub-Saharan Africa.
