A deeper level of extraction can be added to allow you to scrape the top-selling items from the first level of the main categories' sub-divisions.\nThe default depth of the crawl is limited to two subcategories. There is a way around this restriction. Start on the main category, scrape two departments. Then remove duplicate category URLs from there and feed them back into the scraper again.\n\u2753FAQ\nDo I need proxies to scrape Amazon?\n\nFor the most reliable results of scraping, you will need to use some sort of proxy along with the scraper to prevent its detection by target websites. You can use both Apify Proxy and custom HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy servers.\n\nTo engage custom proxies specifically, you will need to specify them in the scheme://user:password@host:port format. Multiple proxies should be separated by a space or new line and the URL scheme can be either HTTP or SOCKS5. User and password might be omitted, but the port must always be present.\n\nCan I integrate Amazon Best Sellers Scraper with other apps?\n\nYes. Amazon Best Sellers can be connected with almost any cloud service or web app thanks to integrations on the Apify platform. You can integrate with Make, Zapier, LangChain, Slack, Airbyte, GitHub, Google Sheets, Google Drive, and more.\n\nOr you can use webhooks to carry out an action whenever an event occurs, e.g. get a notification whenever this Amazon web scraper successfully finishes a run.\n\nCan I use Amazon Best Sellers Scraper with API?\n\nYes, you can do so by using Apify API. It gives you programmatic access to the Apify platform. The API is organized around RESTful HTTP endpoints that enable you to manage, schedule, and run Apify Actors. The API also lets you access any datasets, monitor actor performance, fetch results, create and update versions, and more.\n\nTo access the API using Node.js, use the apify-client NPM package. To access the API using Python, use the apify-client PyPI package.\n\nCheck out the Apify API reference docs for full details or click on the API tab for code examples.\n\nHow can you use Amazon Best Sellers data?\n\nIf you're web scraping Amazon for retail or market research, the Amazon Best Sellers list can tell you a lot about the top trends in e-commerce. Competing directly against top-selling items across Amazon can be difficult, but it also can be a source of inspiration for new products for e-commerce retailers. Data collected on those top-selling items can help you:\n\nstay ahead of the competition\nimprove sales for your business\ntrack up-and-coming products\nadjust your product prices to market levels\nNot your cup of tea?
