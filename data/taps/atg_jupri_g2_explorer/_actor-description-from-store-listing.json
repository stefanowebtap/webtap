            "First, Apify offers a number of ready solutions that can be launched in minutes with zero or very little coding skills. I tested several of them and they work well. \r\nSecond, it's easy and quick to get custom solutions built if needed. I got a custom solution made in less than a week. \r\nPlus, their support team is just amazing (shoutout to Tsveta!).\r\nI discovered Apify less than a month ago and it's already one of the core tools in my stack.",
