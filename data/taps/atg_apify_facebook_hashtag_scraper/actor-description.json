usage, see the\u00a0platform pricing page.\n\nWant to scrape Facebook Groups or Pages?\n\nYou can use the dedicated scrapers below if you want to scrape specific Facebook data.

They only extract what the user has chosen to share publicly. However, you should be aware that your results could contain personal data. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so.\n\nIf you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers.

However, you have to keep in mind that scraping facebook.com has many variables to it and may cause the results to fluctuate case by case. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all-use-cases number. The maximum number of results may vary depending on the complexity of the input, location, and other factors. Some of the most frequent cases are:\n\nwebsite gives a different number of results depending on the type/value of the input\nwebsite has an internal limit that no scraper can cross\nscraper has a limit that we are working on improving\n\nTherefore, while we regularly run Actor tests to keep the benchmarks in check, the results may also fluctuate without our knowing.
