Dropped almost immediately by Atlantic they recorded two albums for CBS/Epic Crawler in 1977 and  Snake Rattle & Roll in 1978. They achieved minor success with the single 'Stone Cold Sober' which was played regularly by FM radio but were never able to shake off the legacy of Paul Kossoff and they disbanded in the late seventies when John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick left to join The Who.\nTerry Wilson now records and produces with his wife Teresa James. Braunagel also produces and has worked with Taj Mahal among others.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Would you drive six and a half hours, each way, from noon 'til morning, without sleep, to see a concert? Evansville, Indiana hosted this band. I knew it would be the only opportunity to listen (and see) them live!\n\nThe band is tight, energetic, soulful and powerful. Strong vocals, melodic and bluesy, in tandem with brilliant guitar work, driven by a versatile keyboard and percussion rythmn section including a jazz influenced basist, showcase their many talents and skills.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to buy this particular album on vinyl (which is far superior in quality than other media ... do you want to hear the full range of pitch and depth?), do it! This is my choice for the best all-time album (and band) that never made it! \"\n\nhttps://rateyourmusic.com/release/alb...", "descriptionLinks": [{"url": "https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/crawler/crawler/", "text": "https://rateyourmusic.com/release/alb..."}], "subtitles": null, "commentsTurnedOff": false, "comments": null, "fromYTUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Crawlee", "isMonetized": true}, {"title": "CRAWLERS -
