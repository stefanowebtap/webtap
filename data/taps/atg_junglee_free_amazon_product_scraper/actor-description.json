    "full_readme": "What is Free Amazon Product Scraper and how does it work?\n\nFree Amazon Product Scraper is a web scraping tool that enables you to extract product data from Amazon by using Amazon's category URLs.\n\nSimply insert the URL from Amazon in the input field and select the maximum number of items you want to scrape. Then download the data from the Dataset tab.\n\nFor an input example, check the Input tab.\n\n7 pages Amazon limitation\n\nAmazon sometimes restricts search terms to a maximum of 7 pages, please validate the number of pages in the URL. To overcome this limit, try to use one of the regular categories and combine it with the search terms. E.g. instead of just searching for Diamond rings, find Jewelry or Women's rings category and combine them with the search term.\n\nHow much will scraping with Free Amazon Product Scraper cost you?\n\nWhen it comes to scraping, it can be challenging to estimate the resources needed to extract data as use cases may vary significantly. That's why the best course of action is to run a test scrape with a small sample of input data and limited output. You\u2019ll get your price per scrape, which you\u2019ll then multiply by the number of scrapes you intend to do.\n\nWatch this video for a few helpful tips. And don't forget that choosing a higher plan will save you money in the long run.\n\nNeed to find product pairs between Amazon and another online shop?\n\nTry our AI Product Matcher. This AI model was created to compare items from different web stores, identifying exact matches and comparing real-time data obtained via web scraping. With the AI Product Matcher, you can use scraped product data to monitor product matches across the industry, implement dynamic pricing for your website, replace or complement manual mapping, and obtain realistic estimates against your competition for upcoming promo campaigns.\n\nMost importantly, it is relatively easy to get started with (just follow this Product Matcher guide), and it can check thousands of pairs of products.\n\nWhy scrape Amazon products?\n\nScraping Amazon products can help you to:\n\nmonitor the performance of categories and subcategories on Amazon so you can put the performance of your own products into context.\ndiscover up-and-coming brands and products to benchmark your performance within its category based on views, conversions and reviews.\nfine-tune your advertising and messaging.\nSample output from Free Amazon Product Scraper\n{\n    \"title\": \"SanDisk 1TB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - Up to 190MB/s, C10, U3, V30, 4K, 5K, A2, Micro SD Card- SDSQXAV-1T00-GN6MA\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X7MPX8L\",\n    \"asin\": \"B09X7MPX8L\",\n    \"inStock\": true,\n    \"inStockText\": \"Only 8 left in stock - order soon.
