You must not enable the \"only data from search page\" option because you need to populate the website field.\nCopy the dataset ID with extracted info. (You can also copy run ID and task ID if you want to run the Google Maps Scraper again as part of the whole flow)\nPaste the ID to Google Maps Email Extractor \ud83d\udd17 and click Start.\nDownload your dataset containing contact details.\n\nIf you need guidance on how to run the scraper, you can follow our step-by-step tutorial \ud83d\udd17.\n\nInput example\n\nYou can provide ID or full name of the Google Maps Scraper source (can be ID/name of a task, run or dataset)\n\nDataset ID example\n\nProvide an ID of a finished Google Maps Scraper run or its dataset.
