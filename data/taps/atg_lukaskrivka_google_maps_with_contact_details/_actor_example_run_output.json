She managed to get a time slot for 3 persons in the pool. I was very thankful to her. Really appreciate her help. We got a free upgrade to deluxe king room facing the garden on the 49th floor. The room is big with an awesome balcony view. When I booked the hotel, i wrote in comment that it was my wedding anniversary. We got complimentary lovely chocolate cake and a coffee cup made of chocolate. So wonderful. There were so much things to do. We need to book a slot for the gym, a slot sauna/hot tub for female and free access to the sky park observation deck. We also had a good dinner at Spargo. Origin + Bloom has fantastic sandwiches n breakfast options where hotel guests got 20% discount. I recommend Early Riser bun. Overall, it\u2019s a marvellous stay here.", "textTranslated": null, "publishAt": "2 years ago", "publishedAtDate": "2020-12-12T16:35:50.666Z", "likesCount": 0, "reviewId": "ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTME56N3FnRRAB", "reviewUrl": "https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTME56N3FnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x26c9afefa555dd7!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICS0Nz7qgE%7CCgwI5uLT_gUQ8OjxvQI%7C?hl=en-US", "reviewerId": "113235938724027892276", "reviewerUrl": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113235938724027892276?hl=en-US", "reviewerPhotoUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD_cMMQBkkGJyNuzj2svzNQ58nw3bU86df2JqR7muC-FftrcI3o=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100", "reviewerNumberOfReviews": 153, "isLocalGuide": true, "stars": 5, "rating": null, "responseFromOwnerDate": null, "responseFromOwnerText": null, "reviewImageUrls": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH3XOOQWIBjqAs8iJYWFXaw-3-fhqcNdVHxjpc=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPisuYZs-o_VBlVfNeT1hoCI3peZJ6wvnVeOoXR=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuAYCSamD-4gZJGLS44BukOSUGe4syn6JVzXzw=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTjF-YQuMl9_vEqXcuNU9MGE3kqDlrUgAGZZgG=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMoDsy1yfT-hL99Li2jop5kEsvL-YIe72qWWnc=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu64DtgVCK7H7aZ7YCEybX-ik0Yod3BtikZ6Xg=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODMdwQBG7sMTWsVG7x4lPd381g0rzxxIzh5MVQ=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpC4meeq-SoQjZ0xMWoyiEo0Njyx5uEwSwys0D=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmZ-bvguedsGiVU4k2XUDWtNu9JLbB1T1OdIgZ=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlINAvCKt8USg-iNAXdDtLpvymgwC5jvRmDNS3=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXyzzyjlCibDLNtITp84VxSZ1I6zBVHkVa-9O0=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOr3dcxRCtkWinpYc4x9i414AChNhdCqpgzfd0c=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7pxERDXr4Waw2V5ZESkz638rnWEWzaEeg36Bm=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmZxL1MrI26pQrXQLS2W5btFyUKmhrDpZlWb7N=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2EjWB_GOmGMRLNaHuL7lAo-tOhRDTj5Eq_BCR=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS5_zClEou7ABpiFR6w_fF-6UBC8vvjRG3hXtn=w150-h150-k-no-p"], "reviewContext": {}, "reviewDetailedRating": {}}, {"name": "John Soong", "text": "COVID19 Pandemic has caused lots of restrictions to travel. For our wedding anniversary we opted to stay local for a couple of nights to support our local businesses. Many thanks MBS for supporting frontline Healthcare Workers. We were upgraded to a Premium King with Harbour Views, which were breathtaking. The room was cavernous with a balcony, which was great to watch sunrises/sunsets. The toilet was particularly large with separate shower cubical from standing bathtub in the centre, and distinct Toto waterclosets. The minibar was complimentary and foamy Nespresso coffee got us off to right-starts in the morning.  We returned to a lovely chocolate cake in our room in the afternoon-> such a thoughtful gesture for our anniversary! The hotel and adjacent Shoppes provided us with lots to do. A snippet of our cherished memories include eating calamari and sipping drinks (1 for 1!) while overlooking Marina Bay in the evening (Lava on the 57th floor), watching the sunset over Singapore on the Skydeck (free for hotel guests), swimming in the infinity pool with amazing views of the Singapore Skyline at night(book your slot!) and the amazing Future World exhibit at the Arts Science Museum (hotel guests get discounts). Tips for future guests->1) Sign up for the Marina Bay Sands Rewards scheme->you get offers and discounts for lots at MBS 2) We had breakfast included. You can opt for Rise (in the lobby) or Spago (55th floor). We really loved the views at Spago, and it was a tad bit quieter. 3)Free Valet/Parking were included in our package->very useful! 4) Amazing bakery called Origin and Blooms in lobby->the coffee, pastries and sandwiches are out-of-this-world good. The staff were amazingly helpful and cheerful, especially Alan at the concierge desk who was very patient with all our queries, and sorted out an issue for us, and the check-in staff who made sure to send us the lovely cake. The rooms were lovely, but some wear is noticeable if you look very hard.", "textTranslated": null, "publishAt": "2 years ago", "publishedAtDate": "2020-09-25T07:28:47.025Z", "likesCount": 1, "reviewId": "ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNXF5SnN3RRAB", "reviewUrl": "https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDNXF5SnN3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x26c9afefa555dd7!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDC5qyJswE%7CCgsIr7i2-wUQ-Oz-Cw%7C?hl=en-US", "reviewerId": "118201390209737422818", "reviewerUrl": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118201390209737422818?hl=en-US", "reviewerPhotoUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTtfVyQRxGguKZ42o3MIXF1sTT_8uSBa2WJOxDUVi-esLfQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100", "reviewerNumberOfReviews": 90, "isLocalGuide": true, "stars": 5, "rating": null, "responseFromOwnerDate": null, "responseFromOwnerText": null, "reviewImageUrls": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGhOyzLtxGUuy15CHiZeb0AkxbH78OJvwh3HLx=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQlq2SqxIgF2O4whgwGtwp_q2t-s-nfRf0u3Wq=w150-h150-k-no-p", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPynltjfGCInS0mYLr0-MT5jNIntCgKheNgsf4l=w150-h150-k-no-p"], "reviewContext": {"Travel group": "Couple"}, "reviewDetailedRating": {"Rooms": 4, "Service": 5, "Location": 5}}], "contactDetails": {"emails": ["room.reservations@marinabaysands.com", "sales@marinabaysands.com", "Sales@MarinaBaySands.com"], "phones": ["+6566888888", "+6566888826", "+65 6688 3000"], "phonesUncertain": ["+65 6688 8888", "+65 6688 8826", "+65 6688 3000"], "twitters": ["https://twitter.com/marinabaysands/", "https://twitter.com/marinabaysands"], "instagrams": ["https://www.instagram.com/marinabaysands/"], "facebooks": ["https://www.facebook.com/marinabaysands"]}}]
