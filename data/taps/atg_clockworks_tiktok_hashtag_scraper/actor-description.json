If you add more than one hashtag, the results will be split evenly.

This is a hard limit by the TikTok website that cannot be overcome.\n\nHowever, you have to keep in mind that scraping tiktok.com has many variables to it and may cause the results to fluctuate case by case. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all-use-cases number. The maximum number of results may vary depending on the complexity of the input, location, and other factors. Some of the most frequent cases are:\n\nwebsite gives a different number of results depending on the type/value of the input\nwebsite has an internal limit that no scraper can cross\nscraper has a limit that we are working on improving\n\nTherefore, while we regularly run Actor tests to keep the benchmarks in check, the results may also fluctuate without our knowing. The best way to know for sure for your particular use case is to do a test run yourself.\n\nHow much will scraping TikTok Hashtags cost you?\n\nWhen it comes to scraping, it can be challenging to estimate the resources needed to extract data as use cases may vary significantly. That's why the best course of action is to run a test scrape with a small sample of input data and limited output. You\u2019ll get your price per scrape, which you\u2019ll then multiply by the number of scrapes you intend to do.\n\nWatch this video for a few helpful tips. And don't forget that choosing a higher plan will save you money in the long run.\n\nWant to scrape TikTok profiles or search results?\n\nIf you want to extract specific TikTok data other than hashtags, you can use one of the specialized scrapers below, each built particularly for the relevant TikTok data scraping case, whether it's profiles, comments, search results, or all data at once:\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Tiktok Video Scraper\t\ud83c\udf99 TikTok Comments Scraper\t\ud83d\udd0e Tiktok Search Scraper\n\ud83e\udddb TikTok Profile Scraper\t\ud83c\udfb6 TikTok Scraper\t#\ufe0f\u20e3 TikTok Hashtag Scraper\nNot your cup of tea?
