        "The maximum number of posts that will be scraped from every hashtag can be set. If set to 15 or lower, the scraper can utilize a faster method of scraping that doesn't require scrolling.",
        "The tool can download TikTok video files, cover images, and slideshow images. Note that enabling these options will increase the time required for the scrape.",
        "The name (or ID) of the Key Value Store where the videos and other media like thumbnails will be stored can be specified. Omit to store in the default one.",
        "Sometimes Tiktok's API will not return author stats (their hearts, follower count etc) for profile/hashtag/sound pages, so an additional query will be needed. This will slow the scraper down. This can be disabled.",
        "If the requested number of posts is small, the Cheerio crawler (much faster) will be used. If for some reason you need to disable this, turn on this option.",
        "The tool will return all the fields listed in OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS regardless of any policy, legal, privacy or any other limit"
