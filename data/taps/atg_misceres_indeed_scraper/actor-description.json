    "full_readme": "What does Indeed Scraper do?\n\nIndeed Scraper allows you to extract job data from Indeed's job listings: job title, description, company name, location, salary, ratings, employment type, and more. To get that data, just type in the job title and location and click \"Save & Start\" button. Alternatively, provide search URLs or a URL to scrape company jobs in the format of https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Google/jobs\n\nWhat job listing data can I extract?\n\nWith this Indeed API, you will be able to extract the following data from Indeed:\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbc Job title\t\u23f1 Time of posting\n\ud83d\udcc3 Job description\t\ud83d\udd17 URLs\n\u2b50\ufe0f Reviews and ratings\t\ud83d\udccd Company name and location\n\ud83d\udcb5 Salary\t\ud83d\udd50 Employment type\nCan I use Indeed API to scrape Indeed job postings?\n\nAs of June 2023, Indeed provides a range of APIs for developers at no cost. However, it appears that these APIs are primarily geared towards the hiring side of the platform. While they can be valuable for integrating Indeed into applicant tracking systems, tracking applicant conversions, or scheduling interviews, they are not suitable for job searching purposes.\n\nPreviously, the Publisher Jobs API (Get Job and Job Search) used to be available and geared specifically for job searching, but they have been deprecated. Specifically, the Job Search API allowed users to gather data such as position names, company names, location, time of posting, and job descriptions. These changes have led users to seek out alternatives to Indeed APIs, such as this Indeed Scraper.\n\nWhy scrape Indeed?\n\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f Conduct job market research or analysis by salary, rating, newness, etc.\n\n\u2728\u00a0Monitor hiring trends for skills and technology gaps\n\n\ud83d\uddc2 Create a custom database for available positions\n\n\ud83d\udce9 Automate the job search to speed up and simplify the process\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Salary benchmarking\n\n\ud83e\udd3a Competition tracking\n\nHow do I use Indeed Scraper?\n\nIndeed Scraper was designed for an easy start even if you've never extracted data from the web before. Here's how you can scrape Indeed job data with this tool:\n\nCreate a free Apify account using your email.\nOpen Indeed Scraper.\nAdd one or more job search URLs to scrape their info.\nClick \"Start\" and wait for the data to be extracted.\nDownload your data in JSON, XML, CSV, Excel, or HTML.\n\nIf you need guidance on how to run the scraper, you can follow our step-by-step tutorial \ud83d\udd17\u00a0or video guide \u25b7 on YouTube.\n\nInput\n\nThe input for Indeed Scraper should be a job position, location and number of results. For a fuller explanation of input in JSON, head over to the input tab.\n\n{\n\"country\": \"US\",\n\"location\": \"San Francisco\",\n\"maxConcurrency\": 5,\n\"maxItems\": 100,\n\"position\": \"data analyst\",\n\"saveOnlyUniqueItems\": true\n} \nOutput sample\n\nThe results will be wrapped into a dataset which you can find in the Storage tab. Here's an excerpt from the JSON dataset you'd get if you apply the input parameters above:\n\nAnd here is the same data but in JSON. You can choose in which format to download your Indeed data: JSON, JSONL, Excel spreadsheet, HTML table, CSV, or XML.\n\n[{\n  \"positionName\": \"Power BI Report Analyst with Finance Oracle ERP (OTC/PTP/RTR)\",\n  \"salary\": null,\n  \"jobType\": [\n    \"Fulltime\"\n  ],\n  \"company\": \"Purple Drive Technologies\",\n  \"companyLogo\": \"https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/e01ca5b3407aa673eb3e185ba14064b1\",\n  \"location\": \"500 Almanor Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085\",\n  \"rating\": 3.8,\n  \"reviewsCount\": 4,\n  \"url\": \"https://www.indeed.com/company/Purple-Drive-Technologies/jobs/Power-Bi-Report-Analyst-Finance-Oracle-Erp-cd84b0a277f6128d?fccid=b50885016c495d25&vjs=3\",\n  \"id\": \"cd84b0a277f6128d\",\n  \"postedAt\": \"Today\",\n  \"scrapedAt\": \"2023-03-18T19:39:01.111Z\",\n  \"description\": \"Key words to search in resume:\\n\\n Finance (Revenue, FP&A, QTC/OTC, P2P, R2R, Sales Compensation) functional knowledge, Oracle EBS or any other Finance ERP knowledge to understand finance data and create visuals within PowerBI.\\n\\n\\n Microsoft Power BI\\n\\nRequired Skill:\\n\\n Analyze data in Excel, compare data in different excels using VLOOKUP, upload data from excel to Power BI\\n\\n\\n Create visualizations for data in Power BI, work on reports/dashboards based upon defined request and requirements from stakeholders and maintain a catalog of reports\u2019 use and purpose.\\n\\n\\n Report Analyst is responsible for data analysis, data visualization solutions on Power BI to support our various business stakeholders.

There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all-use-cases number. The maximum number of results may vary depending on the complexity of the input, location, and other factors.\n\nTherefore, while we regularly run Actor tests to keep the benchmarks in check, the results may also fluctuate without our knowing. The best way to know for sure for your particular use case is to do a test run yourself.\n\nHow much will scraping Indeed cost you?\n\nWhen it comes to scraping, it can be challenging to estimate the resources needed to extract data as use cases may vary significantly. That's why the best course of action is to run a test scrape with a small sample of input data and limited output. You\u2019ll get your price per scrape, which you\u2019ll then multiply by the number of scrapes you intend to do.\n\nWatch this video for a few helpful tips. And don't forget that choosing a higher plan will save you money in the long run.\n\nWant to scrape Glassdoor or Upwork?\n\nIf you want to extract specific job listing data other than Indeed, you can use one of the specialized job listing scrapers:\n\n\ud83d\udcd7 Upwork Scraper\t\ud83d\udd0d Google Jobs Scraper\n\ud83d\udeaa Glassdoor Scraper\t\ud83e\udde2 Crunchbase.com Scraper\n\ud83d\udcbc Clutch.co Scraper\t\ud83d\udc54 LinkedIn Company Search Scraper\nIntegrations and Indeed Scraper\n\nIndeed Scraper can be connected with almost any cloud service or web app thanks to integrations on the Apify platform. You can integrate with Make, Zapier, Slack, Airbyte, GitHub, Google Sheets, Google Drive, and more.\n\nYou can also use webhooks to carry out an action whenever an event occurs, e.g., get a notification whenever Indeed Scraper successfully finishes a run.\n\nUsing Indeed Scraper with the Apify API\n\nThe Apify API gives you programmatic access to the Apify platform. The API is organized around RESTful HTTP endpoints that enable you to manage, schedule, and run Apify actors. The API also lets you access any datasets, monitor actor performance, fetch results, create and update versions, and more.\n\nYou can use the apify-client NPM package to access the API using Node.js, or the apify-client PyPI package to access the API using Python. Check out the Apify API reference docs for full details, or click on the API tab for code examples.\n\nIs it legal to scrape Indeed data?\n\nOur scrapers are ethical and do not extract any private user data. They only extract what the user has chosen to share publicly, on the website. However, you should be aware that your results could contain personal data. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so.\n\nIf you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. You should\u00a0not\u00a0scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so. If you\u2019re unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. You can also read our blog post on the\u00a0legality of web scraping\u00a0and\u00a0ethical scraping.\n\nNot your cup of tea? Build your own scraper.\n\nIndeed scraper doesn\u2019t exactly do what you need? You can always build your own! We have various scraper templates in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript to get you started. Alternatively, you can write it from scratch using our open-source library Crawlee. You can keep the scraper to yourself or make it public by adding it to Apify Store (and find users for it).\n\nOr let us know if you need a custom scraping solution.\n\nYour feedback\n\nWe\u2019re always working on improving the performance of our Actors. So if you\u2019ve got any technical feedback for Indeed Scraper or simply found a bug, please create an issue on the actor\u2019s Issues tab in Apify Console.",
