I want you to act as a an experienced and skilled JSON input writer for {actor_name}


*** {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS ***

Following is the full list of fields that will be returned by {actor_name}. If an item is not here it won't be returned.
If an item is here it will be 100% returned (regardless of any privacy or any other limit)

*** {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA ***
{input_json_schema}

*** INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO ***
 
Read and think sentence by sentence carefully.
Given the above {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA, {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS and a TASK REQUESTED DATA I want you to return an explanation about wether it's possible to build a json (compatible with the above {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA and the above {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS) that can return data as asked in TASK REQUESTED DATA.

Be clear, specific and coincise in the response.
Do not be speculative, only base your answer on compatibility between TASK REQUESTED DATA and {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA/{actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS.
Do not propose me alternative solutions, like customizations or more data parsing after the request.
1. Specifically return me wether it's possible to get the given TASK REQUESTED DATA with the only and just the params proposed in {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA.
2. Specifically return me wether it's possible to get all the fields of the given TASK REQUESTED DATA assuming as reliable the list of fields listed in {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS.

At the very end return me a JSON object respecting the above FINAL JSON OBJECT RESPONSE SCHEMA, summarizing your answer as the following:

{{
    "inputCompatibility": (one of)
     "Only using the params provided in {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA: No, I am not 100% sure that I can fulfill the params required by given task"
     or
     "Only using the params provided in {actor_name} INPUT SCHEMA: Yes I am 100% 100% sure that I can fulfill the params required by given task"
    "outputCompatibility" : (one of)
    "Assuming data returned by {actor_name} is reliable and solely based on compatibility between TASK REQUESTED DATA and {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS: No, I am not 100% sure that I can fulfill the given task given {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS"
    or
    "Assuming data returned by {actor_name} is reliable and solely based on compatibility between TASK REQUESTED DATA and {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS: Yes, I am 100% sure that I can fulfill the given task given {actor_name} OUTPUT RETURN FIELDS"
    "can_fulfill": false // True if both inputCompatibility outputCompatibility are "... Yes I am 100% sure ..."
    "explanation": "Explain in one sentence why you can fulfill or not",
    "input_params" : // only if can_fulfill is true, a JSON input of params needed to run the Actor
    "alternative_fulfillable_data_request": "restaurants in Miami" // only if can_fulfill is false
}}

*** TASK REQUESTED DATA ***
This is the TASK REQUESTED DATA:  {task_requested_data}

Summarizing: 

Given the RETURN FIELDS: {list_of_returned_fields}

and given list of INPUT: {actor_input_summary}

Remembering MORE THINGS TO REMEBER and to answer in the FINAL JSON OBJECT RESPONSE SCHEMA 

Can you tell me if it's possible to get the following TASK REQUESTED DATA: {task_requested_data} ?
