Just follow the steps below:\n\nCreate a free Apify account.\nOpen Instagram Hashtag Scraper.\nAdd one or more Instagram hashtags to scrape.\nClick \"Save & Start\" and wait for the datasets to be extracted.\nDownload your data in JSON, XML, CSV, Excel, or HTML.\n\nInstagram Hashtag Scraper tutorial\n\nIf you want detailed guidance on how to use Instagram Hashtag Scraper, follow this video tutorial - it will show you exactly how to extract data from Instagram hashtags in just a few minutes:\n\nHow many results can you scrape with Instagram Hashtag Scraper?\n\nInstagram Hashtag Scraper can return tens of thousands of results on average. However, you have to keep in mind that scraping Instagram has many variables to it and may cause the results to fluctuate case by case. There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all-use-cases number. The maximum number of results may vary depending on the complexity of the input, location, and other factors. Some of the most frequent cases are:\n\nwebsite gives a different number of results depending on the type/value of the input\nwebsite has an internal limit that no scraper can cross\nscraper has a limit that we are working on improving\n\nTherefore, while we regularly run Actor tests to keep the benchmarks in check, the results may also fluctuate without our knowing. The best way to know for sure for your particular use case is to do a test run yourself.\n\nHow much will scraping Instagram Hashtags cost you?\n\nWhen it comes to scraping, it can be challenging to estimate the resources needed to extract data as use cases may vary significantly. That's why the best course of action is to run a test scrape with a small sample of input data and limited output.

Instructions about what I want you to do:

I need you to create a JSON file that will be the core of this tool, this json will contain clear and sufficient instructions about how to acccess and use the Apify API "Instagram Hashtag".

So here are the information I need you to organize:
1. name 
 - A descriptive and clear name for this tool.
You have to remove any reference to Apify, API, Actor, Scraper and simply a generic name that describes the tool.
Some examples:
For Google Scraper: "Google Search"
For Tripadvisor Scraper: "Tripadvisor"

2. entities
A list of the 'entities' that will be returned by the tool.
By entity I mean the main type objects that will be returned by the tool.
Some examples:
For Google: "google search result", "google seach ads", "google search related queries"
For TripAdvisor: "hotel", "restaurant", "attraction", "vacation rental"
For Facebook Pages: "Facebook pages"

3. filters
A list of all the filters that can be applied to select data for the tool.
Basically you can iterate for each of the options available into Apify API "Instagram Hashtag" Input and if they are a way to filter data you can add them to the list.
Some examples:
For Google: "keyword", "Google search URL"
For TripAdvisor: "Location", "Tripadvisor url"

4. options
A list of all the options that the end of user of the LLM can apply Any option that is related to the internal logic of the tool (for example use proxy) should not be present here.
Basically you can iterate for each of the options available into Apify API "Instagram Hashtag" Input and if (1) they are not a way to filter data, and (2) are options that the end user can apply, you can add them to the list.
Some examples:
For Google: [ "Max pages", "Result per google page", "Mobile Results", "Country", "Language", "Exact location", "Include unfiltered", "Return full html" ]
For TripAdvisor: [ "Max results", "Hotel checkin date", "Hotel checkout date", "Hotels include price", "Language", "Currency" ]

Return me a json object compatible with the schema defined "A JSON schema about how I want you to respond", like the one defined into (An example about the JSON I want you to return) with just and only 4 params (name, entities, filters, options, filters):
